Company Overview
The Company
Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. (“PSH”, or the “Company”) (LN:PSH) (LN:PSHD) is an investment holding company structured 
as a closed-ended fund principally engaged in the business of acquiring and holding significant positions in a concentrated 
number of large capitalization companies. PSH’s objective is to maximize its long-term compound annual rate of growth in 
intrinsic value per share.
PSH was incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Bailiwick of Guernsey on February 2, 2012. It commenced 
operations on December 31, 2012 as a registered open-ended investment scheme, and on October 1, 2014 converted into a 
registered closed-ended investment scheme. Public Shares of PSH commenced trading on Euronext Amsterdam N.V. on 
October 13, 2014 and were delisted from that exchange on January 31, 2025. On May 2, 2017, PSH’s Public Shares were 
admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”).
PSH has appointed Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. (“PSCM,” the “Investment Manager” or “Pershing Square”), as its 
investment manager. PSCM was founded by William A. Ackman on January 1, 2004. The Investment Manager has the 
responsibility, subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, for the investment of PSH’s assets and liabilities in 
accordance with the investment policy of PSH set forth on pages 38-39 of this Annual Report (the “Investment Policy”).
The substantial majority of the Company’s portfolio is typically allocated to 8 to 12 core holdings usually comprising liquid, 
listed large capitalization North American companies. The Investment Manager seeks to invest in high-quality businesses, 
which it believes have limited downside and generate predictable, recurring cash flows. The Investment Manager is an active 
and engaged investor that works with its portfolio companies to create substantial, enduring and long-term shareholder value. 
The Investment Manager aims to manage risks through careful investment selection and portfolio construction, and may use 
opportunistic hedging strategies to mitigate market-related downside risk or to take advantage of asymmetric profit 
opportunities. For more than 21 years, the investment strategy pursued by the Investment Manager has generated a 15.9% 
annualized net return and a cumulative net return of 2,171.6% for PSLP/PSH (as converted) compared to a 10.0% annualized 
net return and a cumulative net return of 654.4% for the S&P 500, PSH’s historical benchmark index, during the same period.1,3

Chairman’s Statement
INTRODUCTION
The past several years have been marked by some of the most complex macroeconomic conditions in recent history, and 2024 
was no exception. Investors continued to grapple with inflationary pressures that, while moderating, remained above central 
bank targets. The prolonged tightening cycle has caused shifting expectations around rate cuts, which created a complicated 
environment for markets.  
2024 also presented a complex geopolitical landscape, with markets remaining volatile amid uncertainty surrounding the U.S. 
presidential election for most of the year and ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The associated 
uncertainty and tension added another layer of complexity to an already challenging macroeconomic environment.  
Despite these headwinds, U.S. equity markets demonstrated resilience, driven largely by the strength of a handful of mega-cap 
technology companies. While the results of those companies led to strong index-level returns, they also underscored the 
growing dispersion in results among the underlying companies. Against this backdrop, the Board is pleased to report that PSH 
delivered solid performance over the year, benefiting from a disciplined investment approach and a focus on high-quality, 
durable businesses positioned to make sound business progress in varying economic environments.  
The Investment Manager takes a long-term approach to investing and the Board does not expect NAV appreciation to 
outperform the S&P 500 every year. Rather, it expects the Investment Manager to outperform over the long-term – and it has 
done so over recent periods. The Board commends the Investment Manager’s impressive 22.9% seven-year compound annual 
NAV return and 22.2% five-year compound annual NAV return as of December 31, 2024; as well as share price appreciation of 
21.1% and 21.6%, respectively, over the same periods.i,ii So, while the Investment Manager underperformed the S&P 500 in 
2024, it has outperformed the S&P 500 over the seven and five year periods.iii
The Investment Manager has had a strong relative start to 2025 with a year-to-date return of -0.6% and share price 
appreciation of 0.1% as of March 11, 2025.iv  By comparison, the S&P 500 has decreased 5.0% over the same period.
During the year, the Board engaged in a number of corporate actions to benefit shareholders, which I discuss in detail below. 
The Investment Manager also undertook several corporate initiatives designed to position itself for continued long-term 
success. The Board was pleased to see that in addition to these initiatives, the Investment Manager made three new 
investments over the past year, demonstrating robust idea generation and investment activity.  
I detail PSH’s investment performance as well as provide additional information about recent actions taken by the Board in the 
pages that follow.

INVESTMENT MANAGER
The Board has delegated the task of managing PSH’s assets to the Investment Manager as set out in the Investment 
Management Agreement (“IMA”) entered into by PSH and PSCM at the inception of PSH (as amended from time to time). 
Although the Board does not make individual investment decisions, the Board is ultimately accountable for oversight of the 
Investment Manager.
The Investment Manager is a fundamental value investor that utilises a range of engagement strategies to unlock long-term 
value for shareholders and, among other things, seeks to invest in excellent businesses, which it believes have limited 
downside. These businesses tend to be large cap companies domiciled in North America that generate relatively predictable 
and growing free cash flows, with formidable barriers to entry and a compelling value proposition. The Investment Manager 
continues to engage constructively with many of PSH’s portfolio companies through direct board representation in some 
situations, and less formal, private engagement in others.
PSH continues to believe that its ability to access low cost, long-term, investment grade debt is a competitive advantage, and 
its long-term debt management strategy is to manage leverage over time by increasing NAV through strong performance and 
replacing maturing bonds with new issuances. PSH’s debt profile is comprised of a laddered set of maturities, matching its 
long-term investment horizon, with a weighted average maturity of 7 years and a weighted average cost of capital of 3.1% as 
of March 11, 2025. PSH’s total debt to total capital ratio as of March 11, 2025 is 15.7%.vii The Board believes that this amount 
of leverage is conservative, particularly given the quality, liquidity and mark-to-mark nature of PSH’s portfolio assets. PSH 
does not have any margin leverage nor any mark-to-market covenants on its outstanding bonds.
PORTFOLIO CHANGES
As I wrote in my letter to you in August, the Investment Manager established new investments in Nike, which is in the early 
stages of a turnaround under new CEO Elliott Hill, and Brookfield, a leading alternative asset manager with high-quality and 
rapidly growing cash flows. Earlier this year, the Investment Manager also initiated an investment in Uber, the world’s leading 
rideshare and delivery marketplace that is well positioned for rapid earnings growth over the medium-term.
Further information on the PSH portfolio can be found in the Investment Manager’s Report.
CORPORATE ACTIONS
The Board has undertaken a number of corporate actions over the past year.
•
On June 3, 2024, the Investment Manager announced that it completed a sale to strategic investors of a 10% 
common equity interest in Pershing Square Holdco, L.P., a newly formed limited partnership that owns 100% of 
the Investment Manager. The Board was supportive of this transaction which it believed would not impact the 
Investment Manager’s team, its role in man

•
In January 2024, the Board engaged outside advisors to review the Company’s listing on the Euronext Amsterdam 
in light of the fact that the majority of the trading of PSH’s shares occurs on the LSE. The Board concluded that 
delisting from Euronext Amsterdam and consolidating trading on the LSE would reduce regulatory complexity and 
improve liquidity of PSH’s shares which would be to the benefit of PSH shareholders. The last day of trading of PSH 
Shares on Euronext Amsterdam was on January 30, 2025, and delisting occurred on January 31, 2025.
•
The Board authorised a total of $200 million in share repurchase programs in 2024. During the year ended 
December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares at an average price of $47.07 and an average 
discount to NAV of 30.6%. As of December 31, 2024, PSH has spent $1.4 billion to repurchase 67.0 million shares, 
representing 26.9% of initial shares outstanding, at an average price of $21.24 and an average discount to NAV of 
29.3% since initiating its first share repurchase program on May 2, 2017.viii
DISCOUNT TO NAV
The Board closely monitors the discount to NAV at which PSH’s Public Shares trade. During 2024, the discount widened to 
31.2% as of December 31, 2024, but has since narrowed slightly to 30.9% as of March 11, 2025.ix   
As discussed in previous communications, in February 2024, the Board disclosed that it approved amendments to the Variable 
Performance Fee provisions in PSH’s IMA that could reduce the performance fees paid by PSH.   
In conjunction with that announcement, the Investment Manager discussed plans to launch new investment funds and on July 
9, 2024, the Investment Manager launched a roadshow for the initial public offering of the common shares of Pershing Square 
USA, Ltd. (“PSUS”), a new investment holding company that was to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. On July 31, 2024, 
the Investment Manager withdrew the PSUS IPO noting that it had decided to re-evaluate PSUS’s structure in light of investor 
feedback.   
During that July period, PSH’s discount to NAV narrowed meaningfully in anticipation of the PSUS IPO and potential associated 
reduction in PSH performance fees.   
The Board continues to believe that the introduction of additional funds managed by the Investment Manager will be a 
positive catalyst to narrow the discount to NAV at which PSH shares currently trade, and that the most powerful driver of 
long-term shareholder returns and discount narrowing will be continued strong absolute and relative NAV performance.  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE / BOARD
The Board continues to work effectively and diligently on behalf of all shareholders. Nicholas Botta retired as a non-executive 
director of the Company on November 15, 2024, having served as a director since 2012. Mr Botta has been a tremendous 
director and asset to the Board. The Board thanks him for his many contributions.
The Nomination Committee subsequently re

with many of you and look forward to doing so again next year. During the meeting, the Investment Manager presented a 
portfolio update. Slides from the presentation are available on PSH’s website: www.pershingsquareholdings.com. 
PSH’s 2025 AGM will be held on May 1, 2025. Details of the event will be posted on www.pershingsquareholdings.com.  
I will report to you on the first half of 2025 in August 2025, and the Investment Manager will keep you informed of any 
significant developments in the portfolio before then, when appropriate.
