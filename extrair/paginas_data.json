(“PSH”, or the “Company”) (LN:PSH) (LN:PSHD) is an investment holding company structured \nas a closed-ended fund principally engaged in the business of acquiring and holding significant positions in a concentrated \nnumber of large capitalization companies. PSH’s objective is to maximize its long-term compound annual rate of growth in \nintrinsic value per share.\nPSH was incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Bailiwick of Guernsey on February 2, 2012. It commenced \noperations on December 31, 2012 as a registered open-ended investment scheme, and on October 1, 2014 converted into a \nregistered closed-ended investment scheme. Public Shares of PSH commenced trading on Euronext Amsterdam N.V. on \nOctober 13, 2014 and were delisted from that exchange on January 31, 2025. On May 2, 2017, PSH’s Public Shares were \nadmitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”).\nPSH has appointed Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. (“PSCM,” the “Investment Manager” or “Pershing Square”), as its \ninvestment manager. PSCM was founded by William A. Ackman on January 1, 2004. The Investment Manager has the \nresponsibility, subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, for the investment of PSH’s assets and liabilities in \naccordance with the investment policy of PSH set forth on pages 38-39 of this Annual Report (the “Investment Policy”).\nThe substantial majority of the Company’s portfolio is typically allocated to 8 to 12 core holdings usually comprising liquid, \nlisted large capitalization North American companies. The Investment Manager seeks to invest in high-quality businesses, \nwhich it believes have limited downside and generate predictable, recurring cash flows. The Investment Manager is an active \nand engaged investor that works with its portfolio companies to create substantial, enduring and long-term shareholder value. \nThe Investment Manager aims to manage risks through careful investment selection and portfolio construction, and may use \nopportunistic hedging strategies to mitigate market-related downside risk or to take advantage of asymmetric profit \nopportunities. For more than 21 years, the investment strategy pursued by the Investment Manager has generated a 15.9% \nannualized net return and a cumulative net return of 2,171.6% for PSLP/PSH (as converted) compared to a 10.0% annualized \nnet return and a cumulative net return of 654.4% for the S&P 500, PSH’s historical benchmark index, during the same period.1,3",

        "raw_text": "Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd.\n3\nChairman’s Statement\nINTRODUCTION\nThe past several years have been marked by some of the most complex macroeconomic conditions in recent history, and 2024 \nwas no exception. Investors continued to grapple with inflationary pressures that, while moderating, remained above central \nbank targets. The prolonged tightening cycle has caused shifting expectations around rate cuts, which created a complicated \nenvironment for markets.  \n2024 also presented a complex geopolitical landscape, with markets remaining volatile amid uncertainty surrounding the U.S. \npresidential election for most of the year and ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The associated \nuncertainty and tension added another layer of complexity to an already challenging macroeconomic environment.  \nDespite these headwinds, U.S. equity markets demonstrated resilience, driven largely by the strength of a handful of mega-cap \ntechnology companies. While the results of those companies led to strong index-level returns, they also underscored the \ngrowing dispersion in results among the underlying companies. Against this backdrop, the Board is pleased to report that PSH \ndelivered solid performance over the year, benefiting from a disciplined investment approach and a focus on high-quality, \ndurable businesses positioned to make sound business progress in varying economic environments.  \nThe Investment Manager takes a long-term approach to investing and the Board does not expect NAV appreciation to \noutperform the S&P 500 every year. Rather, it expects the Investment Manager to outperform over the long-term – and it has \ndone so over recent periods. The Board commends the Investment Manager’s impressive 22.9% seven-year compound annual \nNAV return and 22.2% five-year compound annual NAV return as of December 31, 2024; as well as share price appreciation of \n21.1% and 21.6%, respectively, over the same periods.i,ii So, while the Investment Manager underperformed the S&P 500 in \n2024, it has outperformed the S&P 500 over the seven and five year periods.iii\nThe Investment Manager has had a strong relative start to 2025 with a year-to-date return of -0.6% and share price \nappreciation of 0.1% as of March 11, 2025.iv  By comparison, the S&P 500 has decreased 5.0% over the same period.\nDuring the year, the Board engaged in a number of corporate actions to benefit shareholders, which I discuss in detail below. \nThe Investment Manager also undertook several corporate initiatives designed to position itself for continued long-term \nsuccess. The Board was pleased to see that in addition to these initiatives, the Investment Manager made three new \ninvestments over the past year, demonstrating robust idea generation and investment activity.  \nI detail PSH’s investment performance as well as provide additional information about recent actions taken by the Board in the \npages that follow.   \nINVESTMENT PERFORMANCE\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, PSH’s Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share, including dividends, increased by 10.2% \nnet of fees, ending the year at $71.11 per share. PSH’s share price increased by 8.3% over the same period as a result of the \nwidening of the discount to NAV at which PSH shares traded from 29.6% to 31.2%.v,vi By comparison, the S&P 500 increased \n25.0% during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe performance of the entire portfolio along with additional information about the Investment Manager’s hedging program is \ndiscussed in more detail in the Investment Manager’s Report.",

The Board concluded that \ndelisting from Euronext Amsterdam and consolidating trading on the LSE would reduce regulatory complexity and \nimprove liquidity of PSH’s shares which would be to the benefit of PSH shareholders. The last day of trading of PSH \nShares on Euronext Amsterdam was on January 30, 2025, and delisting occurred on January 31, 2025.\n•\nThe Board authorised a total of $200 million in share repurchase programs in 2024. During the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares at an average price of $47.07 and an average \ndiscount to NAV of 30.6%. As of December 31, 2024, PSH has spent $1.4 billion to repurchase 67.0 million shares, \nrepresenting 26.9% of initial shares outstanding, at an average price of $21.24 and an average discount to NAV of \n29.3% since initiating its first share repurchase program on May 2, 2017.viii\nDISCOUNT TO NAV\nThe Board closely monitors the discount to NAV at which PSH’s Public Shares trade. During 2024, the discount widened to \n31.2% as of December 31, 2024, but has since narrowed slightly to 30.9% as of March 11, 2025.ix   \nAs discussed in previous communications, in February 2024, the Board disclosed that it approved amendments to the Variable \nPerformance Fee provisions in PSH’s IMA that could reduce the performance fees paid by PSH.   \nIn conjunction with that announcement, the Investment Manager discussed plans to launch new investment funds and on July \n9, 2024, the Investment Manager launched a roadshow for the initial public offering of the common shares of Pershing Square \nUSA, Ltd. (“PSUS”), a new investment holding company that was to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. On July 31, 2024, \nthe Investment Manager withdrew the PSUS IPO noting that it had decided to re-evaluate PSUS’s structure in light of investor \nfeedback.   \nDuring that July period, PSH’s discount to NAV narrowed meaningfully in anticipation of the PSUS IPO and potential associated \nreduction in PSH performance fees.   \nThe Board continues to believe that the introduction of additional funds managed by the Investment Manager will be a \npositive catalyst to narrow the discount to NAV at which PSH shares currently trade, and that the most powerful driver of \nlong-term shareholder returns and discount narrowing will be continued strong absolute and relative NAV performance.  \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE / BOARD\nThe Board continues to work effectively and diligently on behalf of all shareholders. Nicholas Botta retired as a non-executive \ndirector of the Company on November 15, 2024, having served as a director since 2012. Mr Botta has been a tremendous \ndirector and asset to the Board. The Board thanks him for his many contributions.\nThe Nomination Committee subsequently recommended the appointment of Halit Coussin, Chief Legal Officer and Chief \nCompliance Officer of the Investment Manager, to the Board as a non-executive director. Ms Coussin joined the Board with \neffect from November 15, 2024.\nEVENTS / SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\nPSH’s annual investor meeting was held on February 11, 2025. We had more investors in attendance this year than ever before \nand we were pleased to welcome hundreds more to the webcast of the event. I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to interact",
