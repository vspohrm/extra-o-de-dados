All statements, other than statements of \nhistorical fact, that address activities, events or developments that the Fund or the Investment Manager \nbelieve, expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future (including, without limitation, statements \nregarding any objectives and strategies of the Fund) are forward-looking statements.  These forward-\nlooking statements reflect the current expectations, assumptions or beliefs of the Fund or the Investment \nManager based on information currently available to such persons. Forward-looking statements are subject \nto a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the Fund to differ materially from \nthose described in the forward-looking statements, and even if such actual results are realized or \nsubstantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects \non, the Fund.  Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations \ninclude, among other things, volatility in financial markets, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and \ninterest rates, tax consequences, changes in law and other risks associated with the Fund’s trading and \ninvestment program.  Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date as of which it is made; and, \nexcept as may be required by applicable securities or commodities law, the Fund disclaims any intent or \nobligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events \nor results or otherwise.  Although the Fund and the Investment Manager believe that the assumptions \ninherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, forward-looking statements are not guarantees \nof future performance and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be put on such statements due to the \ninherent uncertainty thereof. \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

          "Key Person Events Upon the occurrence of a Key Person Event (as defined below), all Shareholders will be promptly notified and given the option — which must be exercised within thirty (30) days of receiving such notice (the “ Key Person Event Notice Deadline ”) — to redeem all or any portion of such Shareholder’s Shares without being subject to the applicable Monthly Redemption Allowance limitation or the C Shares Lock-Up Period (if applicable). Such Redemptions shall be effective as of the first calendar month-end that is at least twenty-five (25) days following the Key Person Notice Event Deadline.",
          "A “ Key Person Event ” will occur if the Principal (i) dies, (ii) is unable, by reason of illness or injury, to perform his functions for the Investment Manager for a period of 45 days during any consecutive 180-day period, (iii) for any reason other than death, illness or injury, ceases to devote substantially all of his business time to the day-to-day activities of the Investment Manager (which, for the avoidance of doubt, would not be triggered by reasonable vacation time) or (iv) is no longer primarily responsible for the management of the Fund’s portfolio.",
          "Key Person Event Redemptions are not subject to the Monthly Redemption Allowance or the C Shares Lock-Up Period (if applicable), but remain subject to all other terms applicable to Redemptions generally (except as otherwise specifically set forth above with respect to Key Person Event Redemptions).",
          "Payment of Redemption Proceeds",
          "Redemption proceeds are generally paid within thirty (30) days of the applicable Redemption Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter; provided , that the Fund may, but has no obligation to, “hold back” up to 5% of the total estimated Redemption proceeds otherwise payable to a Shareholder in respect of Redemptions made during a single fiscal year until the completion of the Fund’s annual audit for the fiscal year in which the Redemption was effective. The Fund generally does not intend to retain an audit holdback of estimated Redemption proceeds unless a Shareholder has redeemed a substantial majority of its Shares during a particular fiscal year, but may (or may not) do so under any circumstance in its discretion.",
          "Redemption proceeds (including any “holdback”) are held as a general asset of the Fund pending payment and do not participate in the profits or losses of the Fund following the applicable Redemption Date, nor do they accrue any interest.",

Accordingly, the Fund is not broadly diversified. Although the Fund has no formal concentration \nlimits or diversification requirements, the Investment Manager generally does not intend to acquire \npositions that exceed twenty-five percent (25%), or constitute less than four percent (4%), of the Fund’s \naggregate Net Asset Value at the time of acquisition (other than in limited circumstances, such as where \nthe Fund is in the initial stages of acquiring or closing out a stake in a particular position).  \nWhile a concentrated portfolio is conventionally viewed as higher risk (as compared to a more \nbroadly diversified portfolio), the Investment Manager believes concentration can also have the opposite \neffect because the Fund’s portfolio will be significantly weighted towards the highest conviction ideas \nwhose potential risks and rewards have been carefully analyzed (although there can be no assurance the \nInvestment Manager’s assessments will be correct or that unanticipated circumstances and events will not \narise). The majority of the Fund’s portfolio will typically be invested in core positions that the Investment \nManager believes to have the greatest potential to rise substantially in value. Usually this means the \nInvestment Manager will target investments that the Investment Manager believes can generate attractive \ncompound annual returns over at least a three (3) to five (5) year time horizon. \nIn addition to the Fund’s portfolio exposure being concentrated primarily in a limited number of \nequity securities, the Fund’s exposure also may be concentrated in various other respects, including, but \nnot limited to, being concentrated in one or more industry or market sector.   \nShort Selling \nAlthough the Fund’s portfolio is generally expected to have a significant “long” bias, the \nInvestment Manager may from time to time short-sell securities that it believes are overvalued.  The \nInvestment Manager may also use short positions to hedge against a specific identified company risk (for \nexample, a publicly traded subsidiary) or to hedge against sector exposure. \nLeverage \nThe Fund may utilize leverage with respect to its investment activities when the Investment \nManager deems it appropriate. The amount of direct borrowings which the Fund may have outstanding at \nany time will not exceed typical margin limits which are fifty percent (50%) of the Fund’s portfolio value.  \nThe Investment Manager will not initiate positions that would result in the Master Fund’s portfolio being \ngreater than 150% net long.  Leverage involves the use of borrowed funds, primarily margin borrowings, \nto increase the amount of invested capital in its long or short securities positions.

The Shareholders’ liability is limited to their investment in the Fund.",
          "Cash Equivalent Investments",
          "The Investment Manager intends to concentrate the Fund’s portfolio in investments the Investment Manager believes are particularly attractive and have the potential to achieve significant gains over a longer- term holding period. From time to time, a significant portion of the Fund’s portfolio may consist of cash or cash equivalents, such as money market funds, pending the identification of opportunities that meet the Investment Manager’s investment criteria for the Fund.",

          "Although the Investment Manager currently anticipates that the Fund’s primary investment focus will be on publicly-traded securities traded in the developed markets, the Fund may from time to time invest in or generate exposure to other types of securities or financial instruments, as well as invest in less developed and emerging markets. There are no formal limitations on the markets, financial instruments or geographies in which the Fund may trade, and the Fund is not subject to any formal diversification requirements or concentration limits.",

Depending on changes in economic conditions or other factors, the Fund may in the future seek control or influential positions with one or more issuers. In addition, there may be situations that, in the judgment of the Investment Manager, require active efforts to seek changes in particular management policies or strategies, or to change management itself. In such situations, the Investment Manager may, either alone or with other investors, make its views known to management and may seek to influence, in a manner consistent with the Fund’s investment objectives and resources, the management or policies of a particular issuer.",

The Investment Manager may engage in currency hedging at the Master Fund level for and on behalf of the Fund as a whole as well as particular classes, tranches or series of Shares.  Any profits, losses and expenses associated with any currency hedging in respect of the Fund or any particular class, tranche or series of Shares, will be allocated solely to the Fund or such class, tranche or series of Shares (as applicable).",

Pricing for privately held securities (and certain other Level 3 securities), if any, is \ngenerally provided by the Investment Manager. \nThe prices of assets and liabilities used by the Administrator in computing the net asset value of \nthe Fund may vary from prices that the Administrator uses in providing comparable services to other clients \nand from prices that affiliates of the Administrator use in connection with their customer or proprietary \nbusiness.

In processing wire transfers to facilitate investments by the \nFund or for any other purpose, the Administrator is solely acting in a ministerial and clerical capacity, \nsubject to the terms of the Administration Agreement.

        "raw_text": "-47- \nNot a Complete Investment Program \nThe Fund’s portfolio is generally expected to be concentrated in a limited number of investments \nand not be broadly diversified.  The less diversified nature of the Fund’s strategy (as compared to more \nbroadly diversified strategies and portfolios) can result in increased performance volatility and risk.  The \nFund is not intended as, and does not constitute, a complete investment program. \nNo Assurance of Non-Correlation to Traditional Portfolios \nOne of the potential benefits of including “alternative” investment strategies in a traditional \nportfolio is the potential risk control gained from diversifying a portfolio into investment strategies that \nmay not be highly correlated with the overall equity markets in general.  However, there can be no \nassurance, particularly during periods of market disruption and stress when the risk control benefits of \ndiversification may be most important, that the Fund’s results will not be correlated to the general \nperformance of the equity markets.  It is expected that the Fund’s investment portfolio will consist of a \nconcentrated group of positions.  With such concentration and lack of diversification, losses incurred in \nsuch positions will have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s overall financial condition that might \notherwise be mitigated if the Fund had a more diversified portfolio. This may be especially true during \nperiods of market dislocation or volatility.  Since the Fund’s portfolio is expected to have a significant \n“long” bias that will generally seek to be fully invested and may engage in certain hedging activities on \nonly a limited or occasional basis, a general drawdown in the overall equities markets will likely result in \na significant decline in the value of the Fund’s assets or a complete loss.  Unless the Fund’s performance \nexhibits only limited correlation to the overall equity markets, an investment in the Fund will not provide \nmeaningful diversification benefits to an overall portfolio. \nCompetition; Potential Strategy Saturation \nThe Fund competes with numerous other private investment funds, financial institutions and other \ninvestors pursuing similar strategies, many of which may have substantially greater resources than the Fund \nand the Investment Manager. \nThe amount of capital committed to alternative investment strategies has increased dramatically \nduring recent years.  The profit potential of the Fund may be materially reduced as a result of the \n“saturation” of the alternative investment field and competition for the same or similar types of trades and \ntransactions. \nRisk of Loss Due to the Bankruptcy or Failure of Counterparties, Brokers or Exchanges \nThe Fund is subject to the risk of the insolvency of its counterparties (such as broker-dealers, futures \ncommission merchants, banks or other financial institutions, exchanges or clearinghouses). \nThe Fund’s assets could be lost or impounded during a counterparty’s bankruptcy or insolvency \nproceedings and a substantial portion or all of the Fund’s assets may become unavailable to it either \npermanently or for a matter of years.  Were any such bankruptcy or insolvency to occur, the Investment \nManager might decide to liquidate, suspend, limit or otherwise alter trading, perhaps causing the Fund to \nmiss significant profit opportunities and/or to suspend Redemptions.  Even if the Fund does not lose any of \nits assets on deposit with a bankrupt or insolvent counterparty, the disruption of the Fund’s trading resulting \nfrom such counterparty’s inability to continue to function in such capacity could result in material losses to \nthe Fund.  Open positions held by the Fund may not be closed out merely because the Fund’s counterparty \nis unable to execute transactions, and may result in substantial losses which the Fund is powerless to \nprevent. \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

The particular or general types of market conditions in which the Fund may incur losses or \nexperience unexpected performance volatility cannot be predicted, and the Fund may materially \nunderperform other investment funds with substantially similar investment objectives and approaches. \nDeclining Equity Markets \nThe profit potential of the Fund may be materially diminished during market cycles in which there \nis a general decline in equity price levels. \nVolatility; Stagnant Markets \nThe prices of the instruments traded by the Fund have been subject to periods of excessive volatility \nin the past, and such periods can be expected to recur.  Price movements are influenced by many \nunpredictable factors, such as market sentiment, inflation, interest-rate movements and general economic \nand political conditions. While volatility can create profit opportunities for the Fund, it can also create \ngreater risk.   \nAlthough volatility is one indication of market risk, certain of the investment strategies employed \nby the Fund rely for their profitability on market volatility contributing to the mispricings which they are \ndesigned to identify.  In periods of trendless or stagnant markets, certain of the strategies employed by the \nFund may have materially diminished prospects for profitability. \nInflation and Interest-Rate Risk \nFollowing an extended period during which interest rates have been at historic lows in a number of \ncountries, the U.S. and many other countries have experienced rising inflation.  In response to rising \ninflation, central banks and governments have taken corrective actions, including increasing short-term and \nlong-term interest rates or changing monetary policies or interest-rate policies. Governmental efforts to \ncurb inflation often have negative effects on the level of economic activity. The operations of the issuers in \nwhich the Fund invests may be sensitive to interest-rate changes.  To the extent such issuers rely on \nfinancing for working capital needs, their profitability will be materially impacted by changes in interest \nrates.  Similarly, rising interest rates generally increases the costs of any leverage used by the Fund.  As \nsuch, inflation and rising interest rates can adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment and the \nperformance of the Fund. There can be no assurance that inflation and interest rates will not continue to rise \nor have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s strategies.   \nLack of Liquidity \nThe Investment Manager generally expects that all or substantially all of the Fund’s portfolio will \nbe highly liquid under normal market conditions.  However, the market for certain of the instruments traded \nby the Fund may be or may become less liquid.  Liquidity in the marketplace can drop dramatically in times \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

          "Market Risks in General",
          "The Investment Manager’s equity strategies are subject to multiple dimensions of market risk including, but not limited to: unexpected directional price movements; changes in the regulatory environment; changes in market volatility; political and market disruptions; misconduct by management; inaccurate government and financial reporting and unequal access to market information.",
          "The diversification of the Fund’s positions will be limited and may not provide meaningful risk control.  The particular or general types of market conditions in which the Fund may incur losses or experience unexpected performance volatility cannot be predicted, and the Fund may materially underperform other investment funds with substantially similar investment objectives and approaches.",
          "Declining Equity Markets",
          "The profit potential of the Fund may be materially diminished during market cycles in which there is a general decline in equity price levels.",
          "Volatility; Stagnant Markets",
          "The prices of the instruments traded by the Fund have been subject to periods of excessive volatility in the past, and such periods can be expected to recur.  Price movements are influenced by many unpredictable factors, such as market sentiment, inflation, interest-rate movements and general economic and political conditions. While volatility can create profit opportunities for the Fund, it can also create greater risk.",
          "Although volatility is one indication of market risk, certain of the investment strategies employed by the Fund rely for their profitability on market volatility contributing to the mispricings which they are designed to identify.  In periods of trendless or stagnant markets, certain of the strategies employed by the Fund may have materially diminished prospects for profitability.",
          "Inflation and Interest-Rate Risk",
          "Following an extended period during which interest rates have been at historic lows in a number of countries, the U.S. and many other countries have experienced rising inflation.  In response to rising inflation, central banks and governments have taken corrective actions, including increasing short-term and long-term interest rates or changing monetary policies or interest-rate policies. Governmental efforts to curb inflation often have negative effects on the level of economic activity. The operations of the issuers in which the Fund invests may be sensitive to interest-rate changes.  To the extent such issuers rely on financing for working capital needs, their profitability will be materially impacted by changes in interest rates.  Similarly, rising interest rates generally increases the costs of any leverage used by the Fund.  As such, inflation and rising interest rates can adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment and the performance of the Fund. There can be no assurance that inflation and interest rates will not continue to rise or have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s strategies.",

          "It is impossible to predict the time it will take for market price and intrinsic value to converge (if ever). Even if the Investment Manager’s fundamental analysis of the intrinsic value of an investment may be accurate, the Fund may be unable to hold the position until such intrinsic value is reflected in market price.",
          "Reliance on Data",
          "The Investment Manager’s trading strategies are highly reliant on the gathering, cleaning, culling and analysis of large amounts of data from third-party and other external sources. It is not possible or practicable, however, to factor all relevant, available data into forecasts and/or trading decisions. The Investment Manager will use its discretion to determine what data to gather with respect to any strategy and what subset of that data the trading models take into account to produce forecasts which may have an impact on ultimate trading decisions. In addition, due to the automated nature of such data gathering and the fact that much of this data comes from third-party sources, it is inevitable that not all desired and/or relevant data will be available to, or processed by, the Investment Manager at all times. In such cases, the Investment Manager may and often will continue to generate forecasts and make trading decisions based on the data available to it. Additionally, the Investment Manager may determine that certain available data, while potentially useful in generating forecasts and/or making trade decisions, is not cost effective to gather due to either the technology costs or third-party vendor costs, and in such cases, the Investment Manager will not use such data.",
          "Investors should be aware that, for all of the foregoing reasons and more, there is no guarantee that any specific data or type of data will be utilized in generating forecasts or making trading decisions on behalf of the Fund, nor is there any guarantee that the data actually utilized in generating forecasts or making trading decisions on behalf of the Fund will be (i) the most accurate data available or (ii) free of errors. Investors should assume that the foregoing limitation and risks associated with gathering, cleaning, culling and analysis of large amounts of data from third-party and other external sources are an inherent part of investing with a process-driven, investment strategy such as the one employed by the Investment Manager on behalf of the Fund.",
          "Use of Alternative Data",

In order to initiate a “short” sale, a seller must “locate” a source from which the \nseller can borrow the securities to be sold short and in order to make delivery to the buyer of a security sold \nshort, the seller must borrow the security.

These traders make large purchases of a security that has been sold short with the objective of \ndriving up the price of such security through their purchases in the expectation that short sellers will seek \nto limit their losses by buying such security in the open market for return to their lenders, thereby driving \nthe price of such security even higher: a so-called “short squeeze.”  For example, in January 2021, a short \nsqueeze of the stock of the American video game retailer GameStop and other securities took place, causing \nmajor financial consequences and substantial losses for short sellers, including a number of hedge funds \nand funds of hedge funds.  The short squeeze was triggered by users of various social media sites with the \napparent intent of driving up the price of GameStop and other securities for reasons unrelated to the \nunderlying fundamentals of the issuers.

Losses incurred on the \nFund’s leveraged investments increase in direct proportion to the degree of leverage employed.  The Fund \nalso incurs interest expense on the borrowings used to leverage its positions. \nTo the extent that the assets of the Fund have been leveraged through the borrowing of money, the \npurchase of securities on margin, or otherwise, the interest expense and other costs and premiums incurred \nin relation thereto may not be recovered.  The level of interest rates generally, and the rates at which the \nFund can borrow in particular, are an expense of the Fund and therefore affect its profitability. If gains \nearned by the Fund’s portfolio fail to cover such costs, the Net Asset Value of the Fund may decrease faster \nthan if the Fund had not engaged in such borrowing transactions.  \nFinancing Arrangements \nLeverage is integral to the Investment Manager’s strategy, and the Fund depends on the availability \nof credit in order to provide such leverage by financing its portfolio.  There can be no assurance that the \nFund will be able to maintain adequate financing arrangements. \nAs a general matter, the banks and dealers that provide financing to the Fund can apply essentially \ndiscretionary margin, haircut, financing, security and collateral valuation policies and, from time to time \n(for example, during the “market crises” of 1994, 1998 and 2008−2009), have largely eliminated the \navailability of financing in an attempt to protect their capital.  Reductions in available leverage would not \nonly make it difficult for the Investment Manager to implement its strategies prospectively, but also would \nforce the Fund to liquidate its existing positions, likely at material losses.   \nChanges by banks and dealers in the foregoing policies, or the imposition of other credit limitations \nor restrictions, whether due to market circumstances or governmental, regulatory or judicial action, may \nresult in margin calls, loss of financing, forced liquidation of positions at disadvantageous prices, \ntermination of swap and repurchase agreements and cross-defaults to agreements with other dealers.  Any \nsuch adverse effects may be exacerbated in the event that such limitations or restrictions are imposed \nsuddenly and/or by multiple market participants at or about the same time.  The imposition of such \nlimitations or restrictions could compel the Fund to liquidate part or all of its portfolio at disadvantageous \nprices. \nExecution Risk \nThe Fund will execute a number of trades in connection with its ongoing investment activities.  The \ncost of doing so will be materially affected by the efficiency of the Fund’s transactions.  Inefficient \nexecutions can generate substantial transaction costs over time, possibly materially reducing the \nprofitability of the Fund’s positions.   \nInadvertent Receipt of Confidential Information \nFrom time to time, the Investment Manager may come into possession of material non-public \ninformation concerning specific companies which may prevent the Investment Manager from executing \ntransactions in the securities issued by such companies.  Furthermore, the Investment Manager may feel \nitself restricted in its trading due to its possession of certain confidential information even though other \nmarket participants trade on the basis of the same information.  Alternatively, the Investment Manager and \nits affiliates may decline to receive material non-public information which it is entitled to receive on behalf \nof the Fund or other clients, in order to avoid trading restrictions for the Fund or any other accounts under \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose \nperformance diverges from the Investment Manager’s expectations or if equity markets generally move in \nan unfavorable direction with respect to the various equity security positions. The Fund also may be exposed \nto risks that issuers will not fulfill contractual obligations, such as, in the case of convertible securities or \nprivate placements, delivering marketable common stock upon conversions of convertible securities and \nregistering restricted securities for public resale. \nSmall Cap and Mid Cap Stocks in General \nThe Fund may invest a portion of its capital (which may be material) in small cap and mid cap \nstocks.  The small cap and mid cap equity markets are, in general, subject to a number of materially greater \nrisks than the larger capitalization equity market.  In particular, the securities of small cap and mid cap \nissuers are often more volatile and less liquid than investments in larger issuers, and more likely to be \nadversely affected by poor economic or market conditions.  Among the reasons for such increased risk are:  \nthe generally smaller amount of information that is available concerning small cap and mid cap issuers or \nstocks rather than large cap issuers or stocks; the tendency of all small cap and mid cap stocks to trade down \nduring periods of market crisis; the greater chance for management misconduct or incompetence to \nmaterially adversely affect the prospects for the issuer as a whole; and the comparative illiquidity of the \nsmall cap and mid cap market, creating the possibility of unusually wide bid-ask spreads and increasing the \nexpected delay before the market value is brought into equilibrium with actual or realizable value.    \nSmall and mid cap issuers can be particularly vulnerable to changes in economic conditions, \nincluding, for example, interest rates, inflation rates, industry conditions, competition, regulatory \nenvironment, technological developments, political and diplomatic events and trends, tax laws and \ninnumerable other factors outside the control of the Investment Manager, that can substantially and \nadversely affect the business and prospects of the Fund. In addition, small cap and mid cap issuers may \nlack the management experience, financial resources and product diversification of larger companies, \nmaking them more susceptible to market pressures and business failure. \nPreferred Stock \nPreferred stock generally has a preference over an issuer’s common stock as to dividends and in \nthe event of liquidation, but it ranks junior to debt securities in an issuer’s capital structure.  Preferred stock \ngenerally pays dividends in cash (or additional shares of preferred stock) at a defined rate, but unlike interest \npayments on debt securities, preferred stock dividends are payable only if declared by the issuer’s board of \ndirectors.  Dividends on preferred stock may be cumulative, meaning that, in the event the issuer fails to \nmake one or more dividend payments on the preferred stock, no dividends may be paid on the issuer’s \ncommon stock until all unpaid preferred stock dividends have been paid.  Preferred stock may also be \nsubject to optional or mandatory redemption provisions. \nConvertible Securities \nConvertible securities are bonds, debentures, notes, preferred stocks or other securities that may be \nconverted into or exchanged for a specified amount of common stock of the same or a different issuer within \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

Convertible securities generally: (i) have higher \nyields than the dividends on the underlying common stocks, but lower yields than non-convertible securities \nof a comparable duration; (ii) are less volatile in price than the underlying common stock due to their fixed-\nincome characteristics; (iii) have a significant option component to their value which is directly impacted \nby the prevailing market volatility and interest rates; and (iv) provide the potential for capital appreciation \nif the market price of the underlying common stock increases.  The market for convertible securities is \ntypically materially less liquid than that for the underlying common stock and the value of convertible \nsecurities more directly at risk to increases in interest rates. \nFixed-Income Investments \nThe Investment Manager could invest in fixed-income securities, such as debt securities issued by \nthe U.S. government, or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any agency thereof, for defensive, liquidity \nor other purposes.  The pricing of fixed-income instruments is directly affected by interest-rate changes.  \nWhen interest rates decline, the value of outstanding fixed-income instruments typically rises.  Conversely, \nwhen interest rates rise, the value of outstanding fixed-income instruments typically declines.   \nDerivatives in General \nThe use of derivative instruments involves a variety of material risks, including the extremely high \ndegree of leverage often embedded in such instruments and the possibility of counterparty non-\nperformance, as well as material and prolonged deviations between the theoretical and realizable value of \na derivative.  These anticipated risks (and other risks that may not be anticipated) may make it difficult, as \nwell as costly, to the Fund to close out positions in order to realize gains or to limit losses. \nCertain derivatives that could be traded by the Fund may be principal-to-principal or “over-the-\ncounter” contracts between the Fund and third parties entered into privately, rather than on an exchange.  \nAs a result, the Fund will not be afforded the regulatory and financial protections of an exchange or its \nclearinghouse with respect to these transactions (or of the government regulator that oversees such \nexchange and clearinghouse).  In privately-negotiated transactions, the risk of the negotiated price deviating \nmaterially from fair value is substantial, particularly when there is no active market available from which \nto derive benchmark prices. \nMany derivatives are valued on the basis of dealers’ pricing of these instruments.  However, the \nprice at which dealers value a particular derivative and the price that the same dealers would be willing to \npay for such derivative should the Fund wish or be forced to sell such position may be materially different.  \nSuch differences can result in an overstatement of the Fund’s Net Asset Value and may materially adversely \naffect the Fund in situations in which the Fund is required to sell derivative instruments. \nFutures  \nThe Fund may trade futures contracts to gain long or short exposures with respect to issuers or for \nhedging or speculative purposes.  Futures are often inherently highly leveraged (often with margin deposits \nas low as 2% to 15% of contract value) and can become illiquid due to exchange-imposed price fluctuation \nlimits.  Accordingly, a relatively small price movement may result in immediate and substantial losses to \nthe Fund to the extent it utilizes futures in its trading strategy.  Like other leveraged investments, any trade \nmay result in losses in excess of the amount invested.   \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

There have been periods during which certain participants in these markets have been unable to quote prices for certain currencies or commodities or have quoted prices with an unusually wide spread between the price at which they were prepared to buy and that at which they were prepared to sell.  Disruptions can occur in any market traded by the Fund due to unusually high trading volume, political intervention, or other factors.",
          "The imposition of credit controls by governmental authorities may limit such forward trading to less than that which the Investment Manager would otherwise recommend, to the possible detriment of the Fund.  The Fund is subject to the risk of the failure of, or the inability or refusal to perform with respect to its forward contracts by, the principals with which the Fund trades.  Only certain forward trades are regulated by the CFTC.  Assets on deposit with such principals are also generally not protected by the same segregation requirements imposed on CFTC-regulated commodity brokers in respect of customer funds on deposit with them.  Accordingly, the insolvency or bankruptcy of such parties could also subject the Fund to the risk of loss.  The full scope of the recent changes in CFTC regulation to forward markets is not yet known.",
          "Equity-Linked Instruments and Related Options",
          "Certain financial instruments traded by the Fund may be referenced to underlying equities but also incorporate other components — duration, strike price, premiums, etc. — which can result in the Fund’s positions being unprofitable even though the Investment Manager may have correctly assessed the market value of the underlying equity instrument.",
          "The Investment Manager may trade in put and call options, which involve qualitatively different risks than owning the underlying common stock.",
          "Options may be traded on and off exchanges.  An option is a right, purchased for a certain price, to either buy or sell an underlying futures contract, security or other financial instrument.  Such trading involves risks substantially similar to those involved in trading futures and forward contracts in that options are speculative and highly leveraged.  Specific market movements of the instruments underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted.  The purchaser of an option is subject to the risk of losing the entire purchase price of the option.  The writer of an option is subject to a theoretically unlimited risk of loss resulting from differences among the premium received for the option, the strike price of the option and the price of the underlying instrument or reference price used to settle the option.  Market volatility is a fundamental component of options pricing.  The Investment Manager may buy or sell (write) both call options and put options on behalf of the Fund on either a covered or an uncovered basis.",

In \ngeneral, capital can only be redeemed monthly upon at least (x) sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, with \nrespect to Founders Shares, and (y) ninety (90) days’ prior written notice, with respect to B Shares or C \nShares. \nThe Monthly Redemption Allowance limits the maximum amount of a Shareholder’s Shares that \ncan be redeemed as of any monthly Redemption Date (measured as of the first Redemption Date, as adjusted \nfor subsequent gains and losses) to (x) 1/12 (or 8.33%) of such Shareholder’s Shares, with respect to \nFounders Shares, (y) 1/24 (or 4.17%) of such Shareholder’s Shares, with respect to B Shares, or (z) 1/18 \n(or 5.56%) of such Shareholder’s Shares, with respect to C Shares, following the conclusion of the C Shares \nLock-Up Period.  Accordingly, a complete Redemption of a Shareholder’s Shares can only be made over \nthe course of twelve (12), twenty-four (24) or eighteen (18) monthly Redemption Dates, as applicable.  \nAlthough a complete redemption is not required to be made over the course of twelve, twenty-four or \neighteen consecutive Redemption Dates, as applicable, a Shareholder’s Monthly Redemption Allowance \nwill remain at or be “reset” to 1/12, 1/24 or 1/18 of the remainder of such Shareholder’s Shares if a \nShareholder: (i) redeems less than the maximum Monthly Redemption Allowance in effect for a particular \nRedemption Date; (ii) does not redeem Shares for three consecutive Redemption Dates; or (iii) makes a \nnew Subscription to the Fund.  \nThe Fund’s Redemption terms have been designed to complement the Fund’s investment strategy \nwhich generally expects to take large positions with a longer-term view in an attempt to derive value over \ntime.  However, such Redemption restrictions are materially more restrictive than those of many other \nalternative investment funds implementing strategies generally similar to those of the Investment Manager. \nB Shares are subject to a longer redemption cycle and a longer redemption notice period than \nFounders Shares.  C Shares, unlike other Shares issued by the Fund, are subject to the C Shares Lock-Up \nPeriod, and thus a longer redemption cycle than Founders Shares and B Shares, as well as a longer \nredemption notice period than Founders Shares.  Further, Shareholders holding Founders Shares are \npermitted to subscribe for additional Founders Shares under the Founders Capacity Rights.  These \nShareholders (and the Investment Manager Parties holding investments with equivalent redemption terms \nto the Founders Shares) may redeem their Shares and reduce their exposure to the Fund (and therefore the \nMaster Fund’s trading) more rapidly than Shareholders holding B Shares and Shareholders holding C \nShares, having a material negative effect on non-redeeming Shareholders, Shareholders holding B Shares \nor Shareholders holding C Shares. \nIrrespective of the success or failure of the Investment Manager’s strategies, investors’ inability to \nredeem from the Fund on short notice materially increases the risk of an investment in the Fund because it \nmay not be possible to make Redemptions in order to recognize profits or mitigate losses before such profits \nhave been eliminated or such losses significantly accelerated. \nInvestor Concentration; Substantial Redemptions \nA significant percentage of the Fund’s (and the Master Fund’s) capital may be attributable to a \nlimited number of investors.  Such investors (or group of related investors) may be in a position to determine \nthe outcome of investor votes, thereby effectively controlling certain actions by the Fund (and/or the Master \nFund).

          "investors and may make decisions that are not in the best interest of such other investors.  In addition, if one or more of such major investors redeem from the Fund or the Master Fund for any reason (which may be entirely unrelated to the performance of the Fund and the Master Fund), it could have a material adverse effect on the Fund.  Such redemptions could require the Master Fund to liquidate securities positions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, possibly reducing the value of the Master Fund’s (and therefore the Fund’s) assets and/or disrupting the Investment Manager’s investment and trading strategies.  Reduction in the size of the Fund and the Master Fund could make it more difficult to generate positive returns or to recoup losses due to, among other things, reductions in the Master Fund’s ability to take advantage of particular investment opportunities or decreases in the ratio of its income to its expenses.",
          "No Control Over Portfolio Companies",
          "The Fund may from time to time acquire substantial positions in the securities of particular companies.  However, the Fund will rarely, if ever, have any influence on the management of the companies in which it invests.  As a passive investor, the Fund will be dependent on the quality of the incumbent management.  In the case of many of the portfolio companies in which the Fund invests, the Investment Manager would not itself have the expertise or the resources to manage the companies.  There have been a number of well-publicized instances in which management has materially, if not fraudulently, mismanaged companies which otherwise appeared to have superior business models.",
          "Contagion Risk",
          "The Fund (as well as the Master Fund) has the authority to issue multiple classes, series and tranches of shares or interests.  However, the Fund is a single legal entity and there is no limited recourse protection for any class, series or tranche. Accordingly, all of the assets of the Fund will be available to meet all of its liabilities regardless of the class, series or tranche to which such assets or liabilities are attributable. In practice, cross-class, cross-series or cross-tranche liability is only expected to arise where liabilities referable to one class, series or tranche are in excess of the assets referable to such class, series or tranche and it is unable to meet all liabilities attributed to it.  In such a case, the assets of the Fund attributable to other classes, tranches or series may be applied to cover such liability excess and the value of the contributing classes, tranches or series will be reduced as a result.",
          "All classes, series and tranches of Shares issued by the Fund are expected to participate in the same portfolio, except in respect of any currency hedging by the Master Fund on behalf of the Fund or a particular class, series or tranche of Shares.  Any profits, losses and expenses associated with any such currency hedging by the Master Fund on behalf of the Fund or a particular class, series or tranche of Shares will be allocated solely to the Fund or such class, series or tranche of Shares.  Although the Investment Manager believes the “cross-collateralization” risk of such currency hedging (if any) or a co-investment class (if any) is remote, all of the assets of the Master Fund will be available to meet all liabilities attributable to such hedging or such co-investment class.",
          "Substantial Expenses",
          "The Fund incurs substantial operating costs and expenses, and Shareholders are also subject to the Management Fee and the Performance Allocation, where applicable.  Operating costs and the Management Fee are payable regardless of whether or not any profits are realized, and could be higher than those incurred by other alternative investment funds.",

Accordingly, \nthe provisions of such regulations, which among other things generally require investment companies to \nhave a majority of disinterested directors, require securities held in custody to be maintained at all times in \nsegregated accounts and regulate the relationship between the investment company and its asset manager, \nare not applicable to an investment in the Fund.  The Fund also is not subject to regulation comparable to \nthe Company Act in any non-U.S. jurisdiction.  Therefore, the Shareholders do not have the benefit of the \nprotections afforded, nor is the Fund subject to the restrictions imposed, by such registration and regulation. \nThe Investment Manager is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers \nAct. The Investment Manager and the Master Fund GP are currently exempt from registration as a \n“commodity pool operator” with the CFTC pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), and therefore are not subject \nto increased regulation by the CFTC or the NFA.  However, registration as an investment adviser or as a \ncommodity pool operator (if such designation is obtained in the future) does not in any respect indicate any \nlevel of qualification or expertise — much less any approval — of the Investment Manager or the Fund by \nthe SEC or the CFTC.  Such regulation of the Investment Manager will result in limited regulation of the \nFund itself. \nThe Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \nIn response to the financial crises of 2008-2009, Dodd-Frank was enacted in July 2010.  Dodd-\nFrank established a comprehensive framework for the regulation of markets, market participants and \nfinancial instruments that were previously unregulated and substantially altered the regulation of many \nother markets, market participants and financial instruments.  Dodd-Frank could result in certain investment \nstrategies in which the Fund engages or may have otherwise engaged becoming non-viable or non-\neconomic to implement.  Dodd-Frank and regulations adopted pursuant to Dodd-Frank could have a \nmaterial adverse impact on the profit potential of the Fund.  See also “—Regulation of the Over-the-Counter \nDerivatives Market,” below. \nThe “Volcker Rule” component of the Dodd-Frank materially restricts proprietary speculative \ntrading by banks, “bank holding companies” and certain other regulated entities.  As a result, there has been \na significant influx of new portfolio managers into private investment funds who had previously traded \ninstitutional proprietary accounts.  Such influx can only increase the competition for the Fund from other \ntalented portfolio managers trading in the Fund’s investment sector. \nRegulation of the Over-the-Counter Derivatives Market \nDodd-Frank comprehensively regulated the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets.  Dodd-\nFrank requires that a substantial portion of OTC derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and be \nsubmitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses.  OTC trades submitted for clearing are subject to initial \nand variation margin requirements.  OTC derivatives dealers typically also demand the unilateral ability to \nincrease collateral requirements for cleared OTC trades beyond any regulatory and clearinghouse \nminimums.  The CFTC, SEC and U.S. prudential regulators have also imposed margin requirements on \nnon-cleared OTC derivatives and new requirements that apply to the holding of customer collateral by OTC \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

          "derivatives dealers.  These requirements may increase the amount and quality of collateral the Fund is required to provide and the costs associated with providing it.  OTC derivative dealers also are required to post margin to the clearinghouses through which they clear their customers’ cleared trades instead of using such margin in their operations, as was widely permitted before Dodd-Frank.  This has increased and will continue to increase the OTC derivative dealers’ costs, and these increased costs are generally passed through to other market participants in the form of higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the imposition of new or increased fees, including account maintenance fees.",
          "With respect to cleared OTC derivatives, the Fund does not face a clearinghouse directly but does so through an OTC derivatives dealer that is registered with the CFTC or SEC to act as a clearing member. The Fund may face the indirect risk of another clearing member customer failing to meet its obligations to its clearing member, thereby causing the clearing member to default in its obligations to the Fund.  Although in the U.S. cleared OTC derivatives are not generally subject to the same “fellow customer risk” as cleared futures contracts due to the operation of the CFTC’s “legally segregated, but operationally commingled” customer protection rules, if a clearinghouse through which the Fund clears OTC derivatives fails for any reason, including due to a default by a cleared swaps customer of any futures commission merchant (“ FCM ”), the Fund will suffer losses to the extent that such failure causes the Fund’s FCM to default or the Fund’s FCM is no longer obligated to perform on the cleared OTC derivative following the failure of the clearinghouse.",
          "The CFTC also requires certain derivative transactions that were previously executed on a bi-lateral basis in the OTC markets to be executed through a regulated futures exchange or swap execution facility. The SEC may impose similar requirements on certain security-based derivatives in the future, though it is not yet clear when these parallel SEC requirements will go into effect.  Such requirements may make it more difficult and costly for investment funds, including the Fund, to enter into highly tailored or customized transactions.  They may also render certain strategies in which the Fund might otherwise engage impossible or uneconomic to implement.  If the Fund decides to become a direct member of one or more of these exchanges or execution facilities, the Fund would be subject to all of the rules of the exchange or execution facility, which would bring additional risks, liabilities, and regulatory requirements.",
          "OTC derivative dealers are now required to register with the CFTC and the SEC.  Registered swap and security-based swap dealers are also subject to margin requirements and minimum capital requirements, and are subject to business conduct standards, disclosure requirements, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, transparency requirements, position limits, limitations on conflicts of interest, and other regulatory burdens.  These requirements further increase the overall costs for OTC derivative dealers, which costs may be passed along to market.",
          "Risk of Governmental Intervention",
          "The global financial markets have in the past gone through pervasive and fundamental disruptions that have led to extensive and unprecedented governmental intervention.  Such intervention has in certain cases been implemented on an “emergency” basis, suddenly and substantially eliminating market participants’ ability to continue to implement certain strategies or manage the risk of their outstanding positions.  In addition — as one would expect given the complexities of the financial markets and the limited time frame within which governments have felt compelled to take action — these interventions have typically been unclear in scope and application, resulting in confusion and uncertainty which in itself has been materially detrimental to the efficient functioning of the markets as well as previously successful investment strategies.",

        "raw_text": "-66- \nMiFID II \nThe EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2014/65/EU) and Markets in \nFinancial Instruments Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 600/2014) (together, “MiFID II”) govern the \nprovision of investment services and activities in relation to, as well as the organized trading of, financial \ninstruments such as shares, bonds, units in collective investment schemes and derivatives.  MiFID II was \nrequired to be implemented in EU member states from January 3, 2018.  Although the Fund is not organized \nin the EU, and is not authorized or regulated by any EU member state financial services regulator, certain \naspects of MiFID II may have an impact on the Fund.   \nMiFID II imposes certain restrictions as to the trading of shares and derivatives, which could apply \nto transactions made by or with the Fund.  Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Fund may be \nunable to trade shares or derivatives with or through affected EU-regulated firms (e.g., EU broker-dealers) \nother than as provided by MiFID II. MiFID II also applies position limits to the size of a net position that a \nperson can hold at all times in commodity derivatives traded on EU trading venues and in “economically \nequivalent” OTC derivatives. \nMore generally, EU regulated firms that have trading relationships with the Fund may be obliged \nby MiFID II to impose certain requirements on the Fund, or they may seek to do so contractually, with a \nview to satisfying their own compliance obligations.  It is difficult to predict the full impact of MiFID II on \nthe Fund.  Prospective investors should also be aware that there may be costs (whether direct or indirect) \nof compliance with MiFID II. \nThe UK has equivalent rules to those in MiFID II.  Accordingly, although the Fund is not organized \nin the UK, and is not authorized or regulated by the UK FCA, similar consequences to those discussed \nabove would arise when trading with or through UK regulated firms and/or holding positions in commodity \nderivatives traded on UK trading venues and in economically equivalent OTC derivatives.  \nEuropean Market Infrastructure Regulation \nThe European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 648/2012) (“EMIR”) entered \ninto force on August 16, 2012.  EMIR introduced certain requirements in respect of derivative contracts, \nwhich apply primarily to “financial counterparties” (“FCs”) such as EU-authorized investment firms, credit \ninstitutions, insurance companies, UCITS and AIFs as well as non-EU AIFs which are managed by AIFMs \nauthorized under AIFMD.  EMIR also applies to “non-financial counterparties” (“NFCs”) which are \nentities established in the EU which are not FCs.

Where certain thresholds are exceeded, the cost of complying with EMIR, especially the cost of collateral required to meet variation and initial margin requirements associated with OTC transactions and clearing and the risk mitigation measures, may materially impact the Fund’s returns and its ability to trade with certain counterparties.",

In particular, MiFID II requires transactions between FC+s and NFC+s in certain sufficiently liquid OTC derivatives to be executed on a trading venue which meets the requirements of the MiFID II regime (the “ Derivatives Trading Obligation ” or “ DTO ”). This trading obligation will also extend to FC+s and NFC+s which trade with third country counterparties that would be classed as FC+s or NFC+s if they were established in the EU.",

For example, an Investment Manager \nParty may from time to time inadvertently receive “material non-public information” relating to an issuer, \nin which case the Investment Manager would be prevented from transacting in the stock (or other securities) \nof such issuer (including closing out existing positions in such issuer) until such information was made \npublic or ceased to be material, which may result in losses. \nPerformance Allocations \nThe Investment Manager believes the prospect of receiving a Performance Allocation provides a \nstrong incentive to manage the Fund profitably.  However, the Performance Allocation received by the \nMaster Fund GP, an affiliate of the Investment Manager, creates a conflict between the Investment \nManager’s interest in earning a profit in the short term and the long-term interests of the Fund.  Specifically, \nthe Investment Manager may have an incentive to invest Fund assets in investments that are riskier or more \nspeculative than would be the case if the Master Fund GP was only compensated based on a flat percentage \nof capital, because these investments may allow the Master Fund GP to collect larger performance-based \ncompensation. \nSubject to the Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation Reduction and the Series A2 Restricted \nPerformance Allocation Reduction, as applicable, while the Performance Allocation entitles the Master \nFund GP to a priority allocation of any gains or outperformance (as the case may be) attributable to a \nShareholder’s Sub-Series, the Master Fund GP is not subject to any comparable priority allocation of the \nlosses or underperformance (as the case may be) attributable to such Shareholder’s Sub-Series (even if only \nto the extent of offsetting prior Performance Allocations).  Performance Allocations once made are not \nsubject to being rebated or returned as a result of subsequent losses.  \nAllocation of Expenses \nExpenses related to the internal operations and overhead of the Investment Manager and its \naffiliates incurred while fulfilling their respective roles and responsibilities will not be allocated to the \nLinonia Partners Funds, except as otherwise specifically provided hereunder.  However, the Investment \nManager may have a conflict of interest in determining whether an expense constitutes an operating expense \nof the Fund or the Investment Manager’s general overhead.  In addition, the Investment Manager may \nmanage Other Accounts in the future and may, to the extent permissible and reasonably practicable, allocate \nsuch costs and expenses among such Other Accounts (including the Linonia Partners Funds) on the basis \nof their relative capitalizations or in such other manner as the Investment Manager determines to be fair \nand reasonable under the circumstances. \nValuations \nThe Investment Manager generally expects that substantially all of the positions held by the Master \nFund will have a readily determinable market value.  However, to the extent there is any uncertainty in \nvaluing the Master Fund’s positions, the Master Fund GP will have a conflict of interest between providing \nthe most accurate valuations and increasing the value of open positions, and thereby increasing \nManagement Fees and Performance Allocations, as well as the apparent performance of the Fund.  The \nMaster Fund GP and its delegates value the Master Fund’s portfolio in consultation with dealers, brokers \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

          "Through the use of side letters, the Fund may from time to time permit certain Shareholders to acquire Shares on different business terms than other Shareholders; provided , that: (i) the Investment Manager does not expect doing so will have a material adverse effect on the other Shareholders; (ii) no Shareholder will be offered different Redemption terms than any other Shareholder if the Investment Manager believes such terms constitute “preferential liquidity” within the meaning of applicable SEC interpretation or that are not disclosed to such Shareholder and (iii) such arrangements do not violate applicable law or regulations.

          "Aggregation of Orders",
          "To the extent the Investment Manager advises Other Accounts, it may make investment decisions for the Master Fund together with or independently from such Other Accounts.  Investments of the kind made by the Master Fund may often also be made by such Other Accounts.  The Investment Manager may combine orders on behalf of the Master Fund with orders for Other Accounts for which the Investment Manager has trading authority or in which the Investment Manager has an economic interest.  In such cases, the Investment Manager will use best efforts to allocate the securities or proceeds arising out of those transactions (and the related transaction expenses) among the various participants on an overall basis (exact equality of treatment may not be possible in each instance).  While the Investment Manager believes combining orders in this way will, over time, be advantageous to all participants, in particular cases the price could be less advantageous to the Master Fund than if the Master Fund had been the only account effecting the transaction or had completed its transaction before the other participants.",
          "Cross Trades",
          "To the extent that the Investment Manager advises other client accounts in addition to the Fund, the Investment Manager may, in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements (including those relating to ERISA, if applicable), seek to adjust or rebalance the portfolios of investment accounts and/or private investment clients under management by the Investment Manager or an affiliate (“ Advisory Clients ”) by effecting cross trades between or among such accounts or funds ( i.e ., causing one or more accounts or funds to sell securities to one or more other accounts or funds).  Such transactions may involve the Master Fund.  In effecting such cross trades, the Investment Manager seeks to reduce the transaction costs of such portfolio adjustments to its Advisory Clients.  All such cross trades will be consistent with the investment objectives and policies of each Advisory Client involved in the transaction, and will be effected at a current independent market price of the securities involved in the trades determined by the Investment Manager.  Advisory Clients involved in any cross trades will not pay any brokerage commissions or mark ups in connection with such trades, but may pay customary transfer fees ( i.e ., aggregate ticket charges) that are assessed through any unaffiliated broker-dealers through which the trades are effected.  During any time that the assets of the Master Fund are treated as “plan assets” for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, cross trades will be effected only to the extent consistent with and not in violation of ERISA.",

Trade errors are not errors in \njudgment, strategy, market analysis or economic outlook, but rather errors in implementing specific trades \nwhich the Investment Manager had determined (rightly or wrongly) to make.  Examples of trade errors \ninclude: (i) buying or selling an investment at a price or quantity that is not intended; or (ii) buying rather \nthan selling a particular investment (and vice versa).  Trade errors can result from clerical mistakes, \nmiscommunications between Investment Manager personnel and other reasons.  Importantly, however, \ntrade errors are not the function of poor strategies, valuation models, economic expectations, undue \nspeculation, unauthorized trades, or the like, but rather of the physical implementation of specific trades on \nwhich the Investment Manager had decided. \nThe Investment Manager determines whether to have the costs arising from trade errors borne by \nthe client or the Investment Manager by applying the Standard of Care.  The Investment Manager will, \naccordingly, be obligated to reimburse the client for any trade error resulting from the Investment \nManager’s fraud, gross negligence (having the meaning as defined under the laws of the State of Delaware, \nU.S.A.) or willful misconduct, but not otherwise.  The Investment Manager will itself determine in good \nfaith whether or not a given trade error is required to be reimbursed under the Standard of Care.  This \napproach does not contemplate that the Investment Manager would determine whether any individual trade \nerror resulted from the Investment Manager’s fraud, gross negligence (having the meaning as defined under \nthe laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A.) or willful misconduct per se; rather, the Investment Manager \nwould likely consider itself to have been grossly negligent if the Investment Manager determines that its \nsupervisory procedures were inadequate to prevent such errors from recurring with any frequency.  \nThe Investment Manager has a conflict of interest in determining whether a trade error should be \nfor the account of the client or the Investment Manager and attempts to resolve such conflict by an objective \ndetermination of the status of such trade error under the applicable liability standard.   \nTrade error costs can be significant — including market losses resulting from the position \nincorrectly acquired as well as the additional brokerage costs of closing out or reversing the error.  The \nopportunity cost (lost profits) of not having made the trade intended to be made is not considered a trade \nerror cost.   \nAny gains recognized on trade errors will be for the benefit of the Fund; none will be retained by \nthe Investment Manager. \nService Providers \nThe Investment Manager, the Directors, the Administrator, auditors and Prime Broker may from \ntime to time act in a similar capacity to, or otherwise be involved in, other funds or investment platforms, \nsome of which may have similar investment objectives to those of the Fund.  Therefore, they each may be \nsubject to conflicting demands in respect of allocating time, services and other functions between the \nactivities each has undertaken with respect to the Fund and the activities each has undertaken or will \nundertake with respect to other investors or other accounts.

          "The Master Fund maintains accounts at a prime broker through which the Master Fund may execute trades, borrow securities and clear and settle its securities transactions, and the prime broker maintains custody of the Master Fund’s financial instruments. A variety of prime brokers, executing brokers, futures commission merchants and custodians may be selected by the Investment Manager and retained by the Master Fund from time to time (collectively, the “ brokers ”).  Certain of the Master Fund’s assets held by brokers and custodians are segregated from the brokers’ and custodians’ own property, while other Master Fund assets held as collateral or margin may not be recoverable in the event of the custodian’s insolvency.",
          "The Investment Manager uses Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC as the Fund’s prime broker.  However, the Investment Manager reserves the right to change the Fund’s brokerage and custodial arrangements without prior notice to and without the consent of the Shareholders.  No restrictions have been imposed by the Master Fund on the transfer and reuse arrangements that the Master Fund may employ as a means of reducing the cost of any counterparty providing financing to the Master Fund.",

          "The Investment Manager is authorized to determine the broker to be used for each securities transaction on behalf of the Master Fund.  In selecting brokers and negotiating commission rates for the Master Fund, the Investment Manager takes into account the financial stability and reputation of brokerage firms, and the quality of the investment research, special execution capabilities, clearance, settlement, custody, recordkeeping and other services provided by the broker, even though the Master Fund may or may not in any particular instance be the direct or indirect beneficiary of the research or other services provided.  In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions, the Investment Manager need not solicit competitive bids and does not have an obligation to seek the lowest available commission cost.  The Investment Manager may cause the Master Fund to pay commissions to particular brokers that are higher than those charged by other brokers in exchange for products or services provided by the brokers receiving higher commissions, although the Investment Manager in any case makes a good faith determination that the amount of commissions paid is reasonable in light of the products or services provided by a broker.",

If a Shareholder redeems the maximum 1/12 \nMonthly Redemption Allowance of its Founders Shares as of a Redemption Date, such Shareholder’s \nmaximum Monthly Redemption Allowance is increased to 1/11, 1/10, 1/9, 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 \nand 1/1 of the remaining Founders Shares as of the next eleven Redemption Dates on which such \nShareholder redeems capital, respectively, which need not be consecutive Redemption Dates, subject to, in \neach case, the Redemption Reset (as defined below).   \nInitially, with respect to B Shares, a Shareholder’s Monthly Redemption Allowance equals one-\ntwenty-fourth (1/24) of such Shareholder’s B Shares.

        "raw_text": "-80- \nRedemptions by Investment Manager Parties \nInvestments in the Linonia Partners Funds by Investment Manager Parties are generally subject to \nthe same restrictions on Redemptions as are all other Shareholders holding Founders Shares, including the \nMonthly Redemption Allowance.  However, the Master Fund GP (and other Investment Manager Parties, \nas the case may be) may withdraw all or any portion of its Master Fund Account balance that is ultimately \nattributable to Performance Allocations (except, for the avoidance of doubt, the Series A1 Restricted \nPerformance Allocation or the Series A2 Restricted Performance Allocation) at any time without notice to \nShareholders and without being subject to the Monthly Redemption Allowance.  Upon the completion of \nthe calendar year immediately following the year in which the amount of a Performance Allocation was \ncrystallized, any amounts attributable to a Performance Allocation will be subject to the Founder Shares \nliquidity terms.  Investment Manager Parties may also at any time and without limitation withdraw the \namount of any estimated or actual federal, state and local taxes payable by such Investment Manager Party \nwith respect to taxable income and gain incurred during a fiscal year (“Tax Distributions”).   \nThe Principal — Mr. Philip Uhde — has invested a substantial portion of his liquid net worth in \nthe Master Fund.  Although the Principal generally intends to maintain such investment during the life of \nthe Fund, the Principal may redeem capital from the Linonia Partners Funds according to the Founders \nShares terms, except that he may redeem on any Redemption Date on less than 60 days’ prior notice up to \n$2 million in the Linonia Partners Funds in the aggregate during each calendar year. For the avoidance of \ndoubt, the Principal’s investments in the Linonia Partners Funds have been or may be made either directly \nby the Principal or indirectly through the Master Fund GP, the Investment Manager, family investment \nvehicles controlled by the Principal, and tax and estate planning vehicles organized for the benefit of the \nPrincipal and/or his family members (collectively, “Managing Principal Investments”).

Priority considerations for the Investment Manager in structuring the Key Person Event Redemption rights will be preserving value, whether the Fund will dissolve or continue in operation and expedite Redemptions for those Shareholders who elect to redeem.",

The Fund generally does not intend to retain an audit holdback of estimated Redemption proceeds unless a Shareholder has redeemed a substantial majority of its Shares during a particular fiscal year, but may (or may not) do so under any circumstance in its discretion.",
          "Redemption proceeds payable to redeeming Shareholders (including any “holdback”) are held as a general asset of the Fund pending payment and do not participate in the profits or losses of the Fund following the applicable Redemption Date, nor do they accrue any interest.",

If the Shareholder notifies the Fund within five (5) days of receipt of such notice from the Directors that receipt of the in-kind assets (or associated liabilities) intended to be paid out to such Shareholder could reasonably be expected to cause such Shareholder to be in violation of any law or the internal policies of such Shareholder, the Directors will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Fund (or the Master Fund on the Fund’s behalf) to sell the in-kind assets intended to be distributed — which sale may be made without reference to market or most recent prices, or to an Investment Manager Party (any sale to an Investment Manager Party to require the consent of such Shareholder).  In such case, neither the Directors nor the Investment Manager need make any representation as to how long a delay there might be before such sale will be effected and whether there will be a single sale for the entirety of such assets or more than one sale, each for a part of such assets.  No interest will accrue on any amounts due to the affected Shareholder pending such sale(s); provided , that the Investment Manager will cause the Master Fund to distribute the proceeds of such sale(s) to the Fund — and cause the Fund to distribute such proceeds to the applicable Shareholders — promptly following receipt (subject to reserves and/or holdbacks).",
          "Any assets distributed in kind will be valued in accordance with the Master Fund’s valuation policies as of the date of distribution.",
          "Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and subject to ERISA (if applicable), the Fund may pay Redemption proceeds or Dividends in kind to a Shareholder in the form of shares or interests in a special purpose vehicle or a participation agreement (which such Shareholder will not have the option of requiring the Fund to sell), including under circumstances in which a decision has been made to cease active investing and to reduce the Fund’s assets to cash in order to facilitate a winding up of the Fund.",
          "Any payment of Redemption proceeds or Dividends in kind (if any) will be made in an equitable manner as determined by the Directors in good faith.",

The Master Fund GP and the Directors, respectively, do not intend to cause the Master \nFund or the Fund to make Distributions.  However, the Directors generally will cause the Fund to pay \nDividends to the Shareholders if the Master Fund makes a distribution to the Fund.

Any Dividend paid to a Shareholder decreases the Net Asset \nValue of such Shareholder’s Sub-Series and is treated as a Redemption for Performance Allocation \npurposes and determining Proportionate Shares.  Dividends may be rescinded by the Directors at any time \nafter announcement and prior to their Effective Date, and are subject to suspension under the same \ncircumstances as Redemptions.   \nTransfers \nShares may be Transferred only upon the execution and delivery of a Subscription Agreement (or \nother written instrument satisfactory to and accepted by the Fund) by the transferee and on such terms as \nare acceptable to the Directors.

The foregoing will \nresult in the resetting of the C Shares Lock-Up Period for transfers of C Shares, such that the transferee’s \nC Shares will be subject to a new C Shares Lock-Up Period.  However, the Investment Manager may \ndetermine to treat the transferee as if it were the alter ego of the transferor for one or more purposes \n(including in respect of Performance Allocations) and generally intends to do so upon request if the \ntransferee is a Related Investor (as defined below) (as determined by the Investment Manager in its sole \ndiscretion). \nUpon a Transfer of Founders Shares, unless such Transfer is made to a Related Investor, Founders’ \nShares will lose their classification as such, and the transferred Shares will be converted (by way of \nredemption and subscription) into (and become subject to the terms, including Management Fees and \nPerformance Allocations applicable to) a Sub-Series of the series of B Shares corresponding to the Founders \nShares held by the transferor as of the Transfer date, as determined by the Investment Manager. \nA “Related Investor” means, in general but ultimately as determined and permitted by the \nInvestment Manager, any affiliate or immediate family member (e.g., spouse or child) of a Shareholder, \nany investment fund or account managed or sponsored by such Shareholder and, in the case of a Shareholder \nwhich is itself an investment fund or account, any other investment fund or account managed or sponsored, \nin whole or in part, by one or more of the same entities (or affiliates thereof) that manage or sponsor such \nShareholder. \nCERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

This summary is based on the U.S. federal income tax laws, regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions in effect or available on the date of this Memorandum.  No assurance can be given that administrative, judicial or legislative changes will not occur that would make the statements herein incorrect or incomplete.  This summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a particular investor or to certain investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws.  In addition, this summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to an investment in the Fund by persons other than non-resident alien individuals, foreign corporations and U.S. tax-exempt organizations.  Each prospective investor should consult its own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Fund.",

As a foreign corporation, the Fund generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on income or gain realized by it from trading and investment activities; provided , that the Fund is not engaged in, or deemed to be engaged in, a U.S. trade or business to which such income or gain is treated as effectively connected.  If the Master Fund is engaged in, or deemed to be engaged in, a U.S. trade or business in any year, then that status will be imputed to the Fund.  The Master Fund and the Fund should not be considered to be so engaged, so long as (i) neither the Master Fund nor the Fund is considered a dealer in stocks, securities or commodities, and does not regularly offer to enter into, assume, offset, assign, or otherwise terminate positions in derivatives with customers, (ii) the Master Fund’s and the Fund’s U.S. business activities (if any) consist solely of investing in and/or trading stocks or securities, commodities of a kind customarily dealt in on an organized commodity exchange (if the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated at such place) and derivatives for their own account, (iii) any entity in which the Master Fund or the Fund invests that is classified as a disregarded entity or partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not engaged in, or deemed to be engaged in, a U.S. trade or business, and (iv) neither the Master Fund nor the Fund disposes of a “United States real property interest” as defined in Section 897 of the Code.

Furthermore, all potential investors should read the \nfollowing disclosure because it describes certain limitations on the operation of the Fund that may result \nfrom Plans purchasing Shares.  The following summary is not intended to be complete, but is intended only \nto address certain questions under ERISA and the Code which are likely to be raised by the Plan Fiduciary’s \nown counsel. \nIn general, the terms “employee benefit plan” as defined in ERISA and “plan” as defined in Section \n4975 of the Code together refer to any plan or account of various types which provides retirement benefits \nor welfare benefits to an individual or to an employer’s employees and their beneficiaries.  Such plans and \naccounts include, but are not limited to, corporate pension and profit-sharing plans, “simplified employee \npension plans,” Keogh plans for self-employed individuals (including partners), individual retirement \naccounts described in Section 408 of the Code and medical benefit plans. \nEach Plan Fiduciary must give appropriate consideration to the facts and circumstances that are \nrelevant to an investment in the Fund, including the role an investment in the Fund plays in the Plan’s \ninvestment portfolio.  Each Plan Fiduciary, before deciding to invest in the Fund, must be satisfied that an \ninvestment in the Fund is a prudent investment for the Plan, that the investments of the Plan, including the \ninvestment in the Fund, are diversified so as to minimize the risks of large losses, that an investment in the \nFund complies with the documents of the Plan and related trust and that an investment in the Fund does not \ngive rise to a transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. \nEACH PLAN FIDUCIARY CONSIDERING ACQUIRING SHARES MUST CONSULT ITS \nOWN LEGAL AND TAX ADVISORS BEFORE DOING SO. \nIneligible Purchasers \nIn general, Shares may not be purchased with the assets of a Plan if the Investment Manager, any \nDirector, the Master Fund GP, any placement agent, or any of their respective affiliates or employees either:  \n(i) has investment discretion with respect to the investment of such Plan assets; (ii) provides investment \nadvice with respect to such Plan assets for a fee, as described in regulations under ERISA; or (iii) is an \nemployer maintaining or contributing to such Plan.  A party that is described in clause (i) or (ii) of the \npreceding sentence is a fiduciary under ERISA and the Code with respect to the Plan, and any such purchase \nmight result in a “prohibited transaction” under ERISA and the Code.  \nIn addition, unless an exemption from the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and Section 4975 \nof the Code applies, it may be a prohibited transaction for a Plan or Plan Assets Entity (as defined below) \nto purchase Shares in, or redeem Shares from, the Fund if the Fund is a “party in interest” as defined in \nSection 3(14) of ERISA or a “disqualified person” as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code with respect \nto the Plan or one or more Plans holding an interest in the Plan Assets Entity.  A party in interest and a \ndisqualified person include a corporation of which 50% or more of the voting power or value is owned \ndirectly or indirectly by a fiduciary or service provider with respect to a Plan.  Because the Investment \nManager holds 100% of the Management Shares, there is a risk that the Fund may be a party in interest and \na disqualified person with respect to a Plan for which the Investment Manager or any of its affiliates is a \nfiduciary or service provider.  Therefore, in order to avoid engaging in any direct or indirect prohibited \ntransaction, a benefit plan investor may not purchase Shares, or redeem Shares, unless one of the following \nprohibited transaction exemptions applies and will continue to apply while the benefit plan investor owns \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

Each Plan Fiduciary, before deciding to invest in the Fund, must be satisfied that an investment in the Fund is a prudent investment for the Plan, that the investments of the Plan, including the investment in the Fund, are diversified so as to minimize the risks of large losses, that an investment in the Fund complies with the documents of the Plan and related trust and that an investment in the Fund does not give rise to a transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.",

          "In general, Shares may not be purchased with the assets of a Plan if the Investment Manager, any Director, the Master Fund GP, any placement agent, or any of their respective affiliates or employees either: (i) has investment discretion with respect to the investment of such Plan assets; (ii) provides investment advice with respect to such Plan assets for a fee, as described in regulations under ERISA; or (iii) is an employer maintaining or contributing to such Plan.  A party that is described in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence is a fiduciary under ERISA and the Code with respect to the Plan, and any such purchase might result in a “prohibited transaction” under ERISA and the Code.",
          "In addition, unless an exemption from the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code applies, it may be a prohibited transaction for a Plan or Plan Assets Entity (as defined below) to purchase Shares in, or redeem Shares from, the Fund if the Fund is a “party in interest” as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA or a “disqualified person” as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code with respect to the Plan or one or more Plans holding an interest in the Plan Assets Entity.  A party in interest and a disqualified person include a corporation of which 50% or more of the voting power or value is owned directly or indirectly by a fiduciary or service provider with respect to a Plan.  Because the Investment Manager holds 100% of the Management Shares, there is a risk that the Fund may be a party in interest and a disqualified person with respect to a Plan for which the Investment Manager or any of its affiliates is a fiduciary or service provider.  Therefore, in order to avoid engaging in any direct or indirect prohibited transaction, a benefit plan investor may not purchase Shares, or redeem Shares, unless one of the following prohibited transaction exemptions applies and will continue to apply while the benefit plan investor owns",

ERISA and a regulation issued thereunder contain rules for determining \nwhen an investment by a Plan in an entity will result in the underlying assets of such entity being assets of \nthe Plan for purposes of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (“Plan Assets”).  Those rules provide that \nassets of an entity will not be Plan Assets of a Plan which purchases an interest therein if the investment by \nall “benefit plan investors” is not “significant” or certain other exceptions apply.  The term “benefit plan \ninvestors” includes all Plans (i.e., all “employee benefit plans” as defined in, and subject to the fiduciary \nresponsibility provisions of, ERISA and all “plans” as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code) \nand all entities that hold Plan Assets (each, a “Plan Assets Entity”) due to investments made in such entities \nby already described benefit plan investors.

        "raw_text": "-92- \nInvestment Manager will be prohibited from entering into any transaction or engaging in any activity if \nsuch transaction or activity is prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. \nIn addition to the prohibited transactions discussed above, Section 406(a)(1)(E) of ERISA prohibits \na fiduciary from causing a plan to acquire any employer securities that are not “qualifying employer \nsecurities” or to hold “qualifying employer securities” in excess of the limits described in Section 407 of \nERISA.  The Investment Manager will not take steps to determine whether any security acquired by the \nMaster Fund constitutes an employer security of any Plan investor.  Moreover, because the limits on \ninvestment in qualifying employer securities described in Section 407 of ERISA apply to the Plan’s entire \nportfolio, the Investment Manager will not monitor, or be responsible for, a Plan investor’s compliance \nwith such investment limits.  Therefore, each Plan Fiduciary that causes the Plan to invest in the Fund will \nbe responsible for ensuring compliance with these rules. \nThe Investment Manager is aware of several prohibited transaction exemptions that may apply to \nthe transactions of the Fund and, during any time that the assets of the Fund constitute Plan Assets, intends \nto ensure that the Fund’s transactions are covered by one or more applicable exemptions.  For example, \nProhibited Transaction Class Exemption 84-14 (the “QPAM Exemption”) issued by the U.S. Department \nof Labor (“DOL”) exempts most types of transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under \nSection 406(a) of ERISA if such transactions are entered into by a “qualified professional asset manager” \n(“QPAM”) and the other requirements thereof are satisfied.  A QPAM is defined to include an investment \nadviser registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act which has met certain thresholds \nregarding client assets under management and control as well as shareholders’ or partners’ equity.  The \n“QPAM Exemption,” however, does not exempt certain transactions, such as those between a QPAM and \nitself or an affiliate of the QPAM, and those between a QPAM and the party who has the authority to hire, \nfire or negotiate the terms of the agreement with the QPAM.  Nor does the QPAM Exemption permit the \npurchase or holding of employer securities that are not “qualifying employer securities” as provided in \nSection 407 of ERISA or the purchase or holding of “qualifying employer securities” in excess of the limits \ndescribed in Section 407 of ERISA.  In addition, the QPAM Exemption will not apply with respect to \ntransactions involving a Plan if the assets of such Plan, when combined with the assets of other Plans \nmaintained by the same employer or an affiliate of such employer or by the same employee organization, \nrepresent more than 20% of the total client assets managed by the QPAM. \nIn order for the Investment Manager to avoid engaging in any actions that are not exempted by the \nQPAM Exemption, each Plan investor will identify in the Subscription Agreement the Plan Fiduciaries with \nauthority to invest Plan assets in the Fund as well as such fiduciaries’ affiliates.  Each Plan investor will be \nobligated to notify the Fund of any changes in such information.  Although Plan Fiduciaries of Plans which \nown less than 10% of the Fund will not be treated as having the authority to hire, fire or negotiate the terms \nof the agreement with the Investment Manager, such Plan Fiduciaries and their affiliates must be identified \nin the Subscription Agreement because the ownership by such Plans may reach or exceed the 10% threshold \ndue to redemptions by other investors. \nAnother prohibited transaction exemption that may apply to certain transactions of the Master Fund \nis the service provider exemption provided by Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the \nCode.  This statutory exemption applies to certain transactions, such as sales or exchanges of property, with \na “party in interest” provided the following conditions are satisfied:  (i) the transaction is with a party in \ninterest, other than a fiduciary (or an affiliate) who has, or exercises, any discretionary authority or control \nwith respect to the investment of Plan Assets involved in the transaction or renders investment advice with \nrespect to such Plan Assets, solely by reason of providing services to the plan or solely by reason of a \nrelationship to such a service provider; and (ii) the Plan receives no less and/or pays no more than “adequate \nconsideration,” as the case may be.  “Adequate consideration” generally is defined as the price prevailing \non a national securities exchange or, if the security is not traded on an exchange, a price not less favorable \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

          "Investment Manager will be prohibited from entering into any transaction or engaging in any activity if such transaction or activity is prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.",
          "In addition to the prohibited transactions discussed above, Section 406(a)(1)(E) of ERISA prohibits a fiduciary from causing a plan to acquire any employer securities that are not “qualifying employer securities” or to hold “qualifying employer securities” in excess of the limits described in Section 407 of ERISA.  The Investment Manager will not take steps to determine whether any security acquired by the Master Fund constitutes an employer security of any Plan investor.  Moreover, because the limits on investment in qualifying employer securities described in Section 407 of ERISA apply to the Plan’s entire portfolio, the Investment Manager will not monitor, or be responsible for, a Plan investor’s compliance with such investment limits.  Therefore, each Plan Fiduciary that causes the Plan to invest in the Fund will be responsible for ensuring compliance with these rules.",
          "The Investment Manager is aware of several prohibited transaction exemptions that may apply to the transactions of the Fund and, during any time that the assets of the Fund constitute Plan Assets, intends to ensure that the Fund’s transactions are covered by one or more applicable exemptions.  For example, Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 84-14 (the “ QPAM Exemption ”) issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (“ DOL ”) exempts most types of transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under Section 406(a) of ERISA if such transactions are entered into by a “qualified professional asset manager” (“ QPAM ”) and the other requirements thereof are satisfied.  A QPAM is defined to include an investment adviser registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act which has met certain thresholds regarding client assets under management and control as well as shareholders’ or partners’ equity.  The “QPAM Exemption,” however, does not exempt certain transactions, such as those between a QPAM and itself or an affiliate of the QPAM, and those between a QPAM and the party who has the authority to hire, fire or negotiate the terms of the agreement with the QPAM.  Nor does the QPAM Exemption permit the purchase or holding of employer securities that are not “qualifying employer securities” as provided in Section 407 of ERISA or the purchase or holding of “qualifying employer securities” in excess of the limits described in Section 407 of ERISA.  In addition, the QPAM Exemption will not apply with respect to transactions involving a Plan if the assets of such Plan, when combined with the assets of other Plans maintained by the same employer or an affiliate of such employer or by the same employee organization, represent more than 20% of the total client assets managed by the QPAM.",
          "In order for the Investment Manager to avoid engaging in any actions that are not exempted by the QPAM Exemption, each Plan investor will identify in the Subscription Agreement the Plan Fiduciaries with authority to invest Plan assets in the Fund as well as such fiduciaries’ affiliates.  Each Plan investor will be obligated to notify the Fund of any changes in such information.  Although Plan Fiduciaries of Plans which own less than 10% of the Fund will not be treated as having the authority to hire, fire or negotiate the terms of the agreement with the Investment Manager, such Plan Fiduciaries and their affiliates must be identified in the Subscription Agreement because the ownership by such Plans may reach or exceed the 10% threshold due to redemptions by other investors.",
          "Another prohibited transaction exemption that may apply to certain transactions of the Master Fund is the service provider exemption provided by Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code.  This statutory exemption applies to certain transactions, such as sales or exchanges of property, with a “party in interest” provided the following conditions are satisfied:  (i) the transaction is with a party in interest, other than a fiduciary (or an affiliate) who has, or exercises, any discretionary authority or control with respect to the investment of Plan Assets involved in the transaction or renders investment advice with respect to such Plan Assets, solely by reason of providing services to the plan or solely by reason of a relationship to such a service provider; and (ii) the Plan receives no less and/or pays no more than “adequate consideration,” as the case may be.  “Adequate consideration” generally is defined as the price prevailing on a national securities exchange or, if the security is not traded on an exchange, a price not less favorable",

Similarly, during any \ntime that the assets of both the Fund and the Master Fund are deemed for purposes of ERISA to be assets \nof a Plan, the Plan’s share of the fair market value of the assets held by the Master Fund will need to be \nreflected on the Plan’s annual returns/reports.

The Fund’s registered office is Maples Corporate Services Limited, PO Box 309, Ugland House, \nGrand Cayman KY1-1104, Cayman Islands. \nCapitalization \nThe Fund has an authorized share capital of $50,000 divided into 1,000 Management Shares of \n$1.00 par value and 49,000,000 Shares of $0.001 par value each.  The Management Shares, which are held \nby the Investment Manager, do not participate in the profits and losses of the Fund and are not redeemable. \nThe Fund will issue a separate Sub-Series of the applicable series of Shares to each Shareholder \nwith a Net Asset Value determined separately based on such Shareholder’s individual investment \nexperience in the Fund.  The Shares of each Sub-Series are initially issued at $1,000 per Share on the \nSubscription Date and subsequently at the Net Asset Value per Share of that Sub-Series.  Each Sub-Series \nis adjusted to reflect such Sub-Series’ share of the Fund’s net profits or losses, Management Fees, \nPerformance Allocations to the Master Fund GP (if applicable), Subscriptions and Redemptions. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if a Shareholder subscribes for Shares subject to different terms, \nsuch Shareholder will be issued separate Sub-Series of Shares that will be accounted for separately as \nthough they were held by different Shareholders (including for purposes of effectuating Redemptions and \ncalculating Management Fees and Performance Allocations).  Similarly, if a Shareholder makes more than \none subscription for the same series of Shares on different Subscription Dates, the Fund may issue a separate \nSub-Series for purposes of accounting for each subscription separately, if and as set forth in a series-specific \nSupplement to this Memorandum. \nShares are held in registered form only.  If a Shareholder demonstrates that it is legally obligated \nto hold a share certificate, a share certificate will be provided as soon as reasonably practicable after the \nrequest is made.  The Shares are not expected to be listed on any stock exchange. \nSubject to applicable laws, the Fund may establish, without prior notice to Shareholders, new \nclasses, tranches or series which may vary with respect to, among other things, currency denominations, \ninvestment minimums, fee structures, transparency, liquidity, voting and distribution rights; provided, that \nthe Directors believe doing so will not have a material adverse effect on existing Shareholders.  New classes, \ntranches or series may be established by the Directors without Shareholder approval, unless the new class, \ntranche or series would have a preferential claim upon the assets of the Fund on a winding up in relation to \nanother class, tranche or series, in which case the approval of the holders of a majority by Net Asset Value \nof the Shares in the affected class, tranche and/or series would be required to issue the new class, tranche \nand/or series. \nIn the event of a liquidation of the Fund, whether voluntary or involuntary, or otherwise upon a \ndistribution of capital, the net assets of the Fund remaining after the satisfaction of the rights of creditors, \nthe return of the par value on the Management Shares and any reserves that may be established, will be \ndistributed pro rata in accordance with the respective Net Asset Values of the outstanding Shares. \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

Maintaining a limit on a Shareholder’s Proportionate Share may \nrequire mandatory Redemptions or non-pro rata Dividends. \nAdditional Classes or Series of Shares \nThe Fund may in the future offer one or more additional or customized classes or series of Shares \non terms different from those of other classes or series (which may include, but are not limited to, currency \ndenominations, investment minimums, fee structures, liquidity, voting and distribution rights); provided, \nthat the Investment Manager does not believe doing so will have a material adverse effect on existing \nShareholders and such additional classes or series of Shares do not violate applicable law or regulations. \nNew Issues \nFrom time to time the Fund may, to the extent permitted by the FINRA Rules, purchase securities \nwhich constitute New Issues.  Under the FINRA Rules, brokers generally may not sell such securities to a \nprivate investment fund if the fund has investors who are “Restricted Persons,” which includes persons \nemployed by or affiliated with a broker and portfolio managers of hedge funds and other registered and \nunregistered investment advisory firms, or “Covered Investors,” which includes certain persons who are \naffiliated with certain companies that are current, former or prospective investment banking clients of the \nbroker.  The profits and losses from New Issues will generally be allocated to investors in the Fund that are \nnot Restricted Persons or Covered Investors.  The Fund may, however, avail itself of a “de minimis” \nexemption pursuant to which a portion of any New Issue profits and losses may be allocated to Restricted \nPersons and/or Covered Investors. \nThe Master Fund GP and the Investment Manager are authorized to determine, among other things:  \n(i) the manner in which New Issues are purchased, held, transferred and sold by the Fund and any \nadjustments with respect thereto; (ii) the Shareholders who are eligible and ineligible to participate in the \nprofits and losses from New Issues; (iii) the method by which profits and losses from New Issues are to be \nallocated among Shareholders in a manner that is permitted under the Rules (including whether the Fund \nwill avail itself of the “de minimis” exemption or any other exemption); and (iv) the time at which New \nIssues are no longer considered as such under the Rules. \nThe rate-of-return experienced by Shareholders who participate fully in the profits and losses \nattributable to New Issues may differ materially from that of Shareholders who are Restricted Persons or \nCovered Investors. \nFOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY TO: Marcos Mendes\nF6289-D400",

          "The application of a number of the laws and regulations to which the Investment Manager, the Master Fund GP and/or the Fund are subject are both uncertain and evolving.  The Investment Manager Parties and the Fund may unilaterally amend the Material Contracts in such a manner as such entities believe to be necessary or advisable in order to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and self- regulatory determinations.",
          "The Shareholders take no part in the management, and have no voice in the operation, of the Fund, nor will Shareholders have any right to remove the Investment Manager.  Responsibility for managing the Fund and complete trading authority over its assets are vested in the Directors, which have delegated these responsibilities to the Investment Manager.",
          "If the Directors, in consultation with the Investment Manager, decide that the investment strategy or the Fund is no longer viable, they may resolve that the Fund be managed with the objective of realizing assets in an orderly manner and distributing the proceeds to Shareholders in such manner as they determine to be in the best interests of the Fund, in accordance with the terms of the Articles and this Memorandum, including, without limitation, mandatorily redeeming Shares, paying any Redemptions or Dividends in kind and/or declaring a suspension of Redemptions.  This process is integral to the business of the Fund and may be carried out without recourse to a formal liquidation under the Companies Act or any other applicable bankruptcy or insolvency regime, but shall be without prejudice to the right of the Share Trustee, as holder of the Management Shares, to place the Fund into liquidation.",
          "The Fund will commence a commercial wind down: (i) upon the bankruptcy, winding up or dissolution of the Investment Manager; or (ii) if the Directors, in consultation with the Investment Manager, so elect (which the Directors and the Investment Manager may do without prior notice and without any violation of the Articles, the Investment Management Agreement or of any fiduciary obligations).",

          "Side Letters",
          "The Investment Manager and the Fund have entered into “side letters” with certain Shareholders, and may do so in the future, which modify certain terms applicable to a Shareholder’s investment in the Fund which may include, but are not limited to, portfolio transparency rights, reduced fees and “most favored nations” protection.  However, the Investment Manager and the Fund will not grant any Shareholder, or any individual investor in any other Feeder Fund managed by the Investment Manager pursuing in the aggregate substantially similar strategies as the Fund, different Redemption rights if the Investment Manager believes such terms constitute “preferential liquidity” within the meaning of applicable SEC interpretation or otherwise violate applicable law or regulations.  The Investment Manager and the Fund may determine to enter into a side letter with a Shareholder based on any of a variety of factors, including the size of a Shareholder’s investment in, or potential to provide special services or benefits to, the Fund.  Although the Investment Manager and the Fund will not enter into any side letter which they believe would be materially adverse to the Shareholders considered as a whole (except in perhaps extraordinary circumstances in which the Investment Manager and the Fund will generally reserve the right",

Where \npermitted, and subject to certain conditions, the Fund may also rely upon a suitable person for the \nmaintenance of these procedures (including the acquisition of due-diligence information) to a suitable \nperson.  \nThe Fund, and the Administrator on the Fund’s behalf, reserves the right to request such \ninformation and/or documentation as is necessary to verify the identity and/or source of funds of a \nShareholder (i.e., a subscriber or a transferee) and the identity of their beneficial owners/controllers (where \napplicable), and their source of subscription funds.  In some cases the Directors, or the Administrator on \nthe Fund’s behalf, may be satisfied that full due diligence is not required where a relevant exemption applies \nunder applicable law.

Additionally, the \nFund, the Investment Manager, the Administrator and their respective agents may request such further \ninformation as they consider necessary to process a Redemption request and may refuse to remit \nRedemption proceeds (that is “freeze” the Redemption proceeds) until proper and satisfactory information \nhas been provided.
