This Memorandum contains forward-looking statements.  All statements, other than statements of 
historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that the Fund or the Investment Manager

to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the Fund to differ materially from 
those described in the forward-looking statements, and even if such actual results are realized or 
substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects

except as may be required by applicable securities or commodities law, the Fund disclaims any intent or 
obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events 
or results or otherwise.  Although the Fund and the Investment Manager believe that the assumptions 
inherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, forward-looking statements are not guarantees 
of future performance and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be put on such statements due to the 
inherent uncertainty thereof.

“Master-Feeder” 
Structure 
The Fund operates as a “feeder fund,” investing all of its capital in Linonia

except for such capital as the Investment Manager determines may be 
reasonably necessary or appropriate to pay any fees, expenses or other 
costs related to the Fund itself.  The Fund, together with any other “feeder

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-2- 
“Master-Feeder” 
Structure (cont.) 
The Fund is required to invest all of its capital in the Master Fund, except 
for such capital as the Investment Manager determines may be reasonably 
necessary or appropriate to pay any fees, expenses or other costs related to 
the Fund itself (although it is currently anticipated that all of the operating 
costs and expenses of the Feeder Funds will be paid by the Master Fund 
on behalf of the Feeder Funds). Accordingly, an investment in the Fund is 
the functional and economic equivalent of an investment in the Master 
Fund.   

References to the Fund investing “all of its capital” in the Master Fund 
exclude capital the Investment Manager determines should be reserved by 
the Fund to pay any fees, expenses or other costs related to the Fund 
directly, and references to the trading and investment activities, strategies 
and objectives of, and the payment of fees and expenses by, the Fund mean 
the Fund doing so indirectly through its investment in the Master Fund.  
The General Partner 
of the Master Fund 
Linonia Capital Partners GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, 
is the general partner of the Master Fund (the “Master Fund GP”).  The 
Master Fund GP was formed for the specific purpose of acting as the 
general partner to the Master Fund. 

The Master Fund GP has delegated authority over the management of the 
Master Fund’s operations and investment activities to the Investment 
Manager.  References to the Master Fund GP include the Investment 
Manager acting on its behalf pursuant to such delegated authority unless 
the context otherwise requires.  
The Investment 
Manager  
The Linonia Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership affiliated with 
the Master Fund GP (the “Investment Manager”), serves as the 
investment manager to the Fund and the Master Fund pursuant to the terms 
of an investment management agreement (the “Investment Management 
Agreement”). 

The Investment Manager is registered with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as an investment adviser under the U.S. 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). 

Mr. Philip Uhde, the founder and sole principal of the Master Fund GP and 
the Investment Manager (the “Principal”), is ultimately responsible for 
making all trading and investment decisions for the Fund.  Mr. Uhde has 
invested a substantial portion of his liquid net worth in the Linonia Partners 
Funds. 
Investment Objective 
and Strategy 
The Fund’s objective is to generate attractive absolute total returns over 
the long-term, and through multiple economic cycles, while minimizing 
the risk of permanent impairment of capital.

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-3- 
Investment Objective 
and Strategy (cont.) 
The Fund applies a “private equity” lens to the public markets. The 
Investment Manager conducts fundamental research to identify companies 
whose long-term prospects it believes may be under-appreciated by public 
markets investors. Although the Fund generally invests in marketable 
securities, and in practice owns only a small percentage of each company 
in which it invests, it generally evaluates each investment as though it were 
to own the entire company over the long-term. 

Although the Fund’s portfolio is generally expected to have a significant 
“long” bias, the Investment Manager may from time to time short-sell 
securities that it believes are overvalued.  The Investment Manager may 
also use short positions to hedge against a specific identified company risk 
(for example, a publicly traded subsidiary) or to hedge against sector 
exposure. 

The Investment Manager favors the following characteristics when 
evaluating prospective investments: 
• 
dominant market positions (or the potential for dominant market 
positions in the future); 
• 
companies that play a role in their industries that can be likened to 
that of an unregulated utility; 
• 
companies that are a small share of system revenues but a high 
share of system value; 
• 
high revenue retention (low customer churn rates) resulting in 
“bond-like” or “annuity-like” cashflows; 
• 
franchise assets (such as intellectual property); 
• 
high market shares and/or win rates in their markets and/or 
channels; 
• 
attractive market structures and end markets; 
• 
substantial free cash flow generation; 
• 
high returns on invested capital (or the potential for returns on 
capital to improve significantly); 
• 
wide (and/or widening) competitive moats; 
• 
significant pricing power; and 
• 
appropriate capital structures.

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-4- 
Investment Objective 
and Strategy (cont.) 
In order to concentrate the Fund’s capital in investments that the 
Investment Manager believes offer the highest risk-adjusted returns, the 
Fund’s portfolio is generally expected to be concentrated in between five 
(5) and fifteen (15) “long” positions, with the majority of the Fund’s 
portfolio typically invested in five (5) to ten (10) “high conviction” core 
positions that the Investment Manager believes to have the potential to rise 
substantially in value over a three (3) to five (5) year time frame (although 
actual holding periods may be longer or shorter depending on the 
Investment Manager’s ongoing assessment of the Fund’s positions). 
Accordingly, the Fund is not broadly diversified. Although the Fund has 
no formal concentration limits or diversification requirements, the 
Investment Manager generally does not intend to acquire positions that 
exceed twenty-five percent (25%), or constitute less than four percent 
(4%), of the Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value at the time of acquisition 
(other than in limited circumstances, such as where the Fund is in the initial 
stages of acquiring or closing out a stake in a particular position). 

While a concentrated portfolio is conventionally viewed as higher risk (as 
compared to a more broadly diversified portfolio), the Investment 
Manager believes concentration can also have the opposite effect because 
the Fund’s portfolio will be significantly weighted towards the highest 
conviction ideas whose potential risks and rewards have been carefully 
analyzed (although there can be no assurance the Investment Manager’s 
assessments will be correct or that unanticipated circumstances and events 
will not arise). The majority of the Fund’s portfolio will typically be 
invested in core positions that the Investment Manager believes to have 
the greatest potential to rise substantially in value. Usually this means the 
Investment Manager will target investments that the Investment Manager 
believes can generate attractive compound annual returns over at least a 
three (3) to five (5) year time horizon. 

The Fund utilizes leverage with respect to its investment activities when 
deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager.  The use of leverage 
increases both the proportionate amount of potential gain, as well as 
potential loss, relative to the Fund’s equity capital.  If the value of a margin 
position declines, the Fund’s prime broker or other counterparty may be 
entitled to liquidate the securities serving as collateral for such margin 
position, resulting in a loss proportionately greater than would be the case 
absent such use of leverage.  The Investment Manager will not initiate 
positions that would result in the Master Fund’s portfolio being greater 
than 150% net long.  
See “The Fund’s Investment Objective and Strategy,” below, for a more 
detailed description of the Fund’s investment strategy.

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-5- 
Limited Performance 
History 
As of the date of this Memorandum, the Investment Manager, the Fund 
and the Master Fund have only limited operating and performance history. 

The past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future 
results. Similarly, the past performance of the Principal managing other 
accounts implementing similar strategies to the Fund is not necessarily 
indicative of the Fund’s future results.  There can be no assurance that the 
performance of the Fund will be comparable in the future to what the Fund, 
or any other account managed by the Principal while associated with other 
investment management firms, has been in the past.    
The Offering 
The Offering 
The Fund generally intends to offer non-voting redeemable participating 
shares (“Shares”) on a continuous basis as of the beginning of each 
calendar month or such other dates as the Investment Manager may 
determine (each, a “Subscription Date”).   
Founders Shares 
The Fund initially offered Series A1 Founders Shares (“Series A1 
Founders Shares”) and Series A2 Founders Shares (“Series A2 
Founders Shares”) (together, “Founders Shares”) during a limited 
offering period that expired on June 30, 2024 (the “Founders Investment 
Period”), subject to the Founders Capacity Rights (as described below).

C Shares Capacity 
Rights 
Any Shareholder issued C Shares will have the right (but not the 
obligation), at any time after such Shareholder’s admission to the Fund, to 
make one or more additional subscriptions for C Shares in an aggregate 
amount up to $4 for each $1 that is invested during the C Shares Investment 
Period (the “C Shares Capacity Rights”).  By way of example (and solely 
for illustrative purposes), if a Shareholder’s aggregate Subscriptions 
during the C Shares Investment Period totals $150 million of Series C1 
Shares, such Shareholder will be permitted to invest an additional amount 
of up to $600 million of Series C1 Shares in the aggregate over the duration 
of its time as a Shareholder. 
Additional Classes or 
Series of Shares 
The Fund may in the future offer one or more additional or customized 
classes or series of Shares on terms different from those of other classes or 
series which may include, but are not limited to, currency denominations, 
investment minimums, fee structures, liquidity, voting and distribution 
rights; provided, that the Investment Manager does not believe doing so 
will have a material adverse effect on existing Shareholders or violate 
applicable law or regulations. 

Except for the Founders Capacity Rights, the B Shares Capacity Rights 
and the C Shares Capacity Rights, the Fund may cease offering any class 
or series of Shares at any time without providing notice to, or receiving 
consent from, the Shareholders. 
Minimum Investment 
The minimum initial investment (“Subscription”) by each investor in the 
Fund (each, a “Shareholder”) is $25 million with respect to Founders 
Shares, $50 million with respect to Series B1 Shares and $100 million with 
respect to Series B2 Shares, Series B3 Shares and Series C1 Shares.  In 
general, additional Subscriptions may be made in whole multiples of 
$1,000,000, whether at the time of an initial Subscription or thereafter 
unless otherwise agreed by the Investment Manager.   

The Fund may accept or reject subscriptions in whole or in part, and waive 
the foregoing minimums (subject to a regulatory minimum initial 
investment amount of $100,000 or such other amount as prescribed under 
Cayman Islands law) in its discretion.   
Investments by 
Investment Manager 
Parties 
One or more of the Investment Manager, its affiliates and/or their 
respective employees are permitted to invest either directly or indirectly in 
the Fund.  Such investments generally will not be subject to Management 
Fees and Performance Allocations (as defined below), but are otherwise 
generally subject to the same investment terms as other Shareholders.

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-8- 
Individual Sub-Series 
of Shares 
The Fund will issue a separate sub-series of the applicable series of Shares 
(“Sub-Series”) in respect of each Shareholder with a Net Asset Value 
determined separately based on such Shareholder’s individual investment 
experience in the Fund. However, if a Shareholder subscribes for Shares 
subject to different terms, such Shareholder will be issued separate Sub-
Series of Shares that will be accounted for separately as though they were 
held by different Shareholders (including for purposes of effectuating 
Redemptions and calculating Management Fees and Performance 
Allocations).  Similarly, in the case of certain series, if a Shareholder 
makes more than one subscription for the same series of Shares on 
different Subscription Dates, the Fund may issue a separate Sub-Series for 
purposes of accounting for each subscription separately. 

Each Sub-Series participates in the performance of the Fund in accordance 
with the fraction (expressed as a percentage; such Sub-Series’ 
“Proportionate Share”) the numerator of which is the Gross Asset Value 
(as defined below) of such Sub-Series and the denominator of which is the 
aggregate Gross Asset Value of all Sub-Series of Shares. Proportionate 
Shares are determined as of the beginning of each accounting period to 
reflect any subscriptions then effective, and any Redemptions effective as 
of the end of the preceding accounting period, and any other applicable 
adjustments. 

“Net Asset Value” of the Fund (or a series or Sub-Series) equals the value 
of the Fund’s assets less all liabilities (or the assets and liabilities 
attributable to a series or Sub-Series), including, but not limited to, 
Management Fees and accrued Performance Allocations not yet made. 

“Gross Asset Value” of the Fund (or a series or Sub-Series) equals Net 
Asset Value after reduction for all accrued expenses but prior to reduction 
for the Management Fee being calculated at the beginning of each month 
and any accrued Performance Allocations that would be made were the 
date of determination the end of a Performance Allocation Calculation 
Period.   

A “Performance Allocation Calculation Period” begins each January 1 
and ends each December 31 (or if a Master Fund Account (as defined 
below) is established after January 1, the period from the effective date of 
the corresponding Subscription and the immediately following December 
31).

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-9- 
Master Fund Accounts 
In general, all accounting procedures and financial allocations are made at 
the Master Fund level (which are reflected in the Net Asset Value of each 
Shareholder’s Sub-Series of Shares). In particular, all Management Fees 
and Performance Allocations are calculated and paid/made by the Master 
Fund (and not by the Fund directly).  In order to facilitate the equitable 
allocation of fees, expenses and Performance Allocations among different 
Shareholders, the Master Fund establishes a separate sub-capital account 
(a “Master Fund Account”) corresponding to each Sub-Series of Shares 
held by a Shareholder. All expenses, Management Fees and Performance 
Allocations paid or made by the Master Fund in respect of a particular 
Master Fund Account result in a corresponding decrease in the Net Asset 
Value of the Shareholder’s Sub-Series corresponding to such Master Fund 
Account. 

References in this Memorandum to a Shareholder’s Sub-Series include 
reference to the corresponding Master Fund Account(s) for purposes of 
calculating Management Fees and Performance Allocations.   
Placement Agents 
Shares are currently being offered directly by the Fund.  The Investment 
Manager and/or the Fund may also engage duly licensed selling agents to 
assist in marketing the Shares, which may include one or more affiliates 
of the Investment Manager.  Shareholders introduced to the Fund through 
a placement agent may be subject to initial and/or ongoing placement or 
referral fees to the persons who introduced such Shareholders.  All affected 
investors will be informed of any such fees applicable to their Subscription 
prior to the acceptance of such Subscription (and may, if they wish, 
thereupon revoke their Subscription). The Investment Manager and the 
Master Fund GP may also compensate persons who introduce investors 
out of their own resources (including by sharing a portion of their 
Management Fees and/or Performance Allocations with such placement 
agents). 
Eligible Investors 
In general, only: (i) U.S. tax-exempt investors that are both “accredited 
investors,” as defined in Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act of 
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and “qualified purchasers,” as 
defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 
“Company Act”); and (ii) certain non-U.S. investors may acquire Shares. 
All Shareholders must also be financially sophisticated and capable of 
evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Fund. 

The Subscription Agreement contains detailed information concerning the 
Shareholder qualifications required to invest in the Fund.

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-10- 
ERISA 
During any time that the underlying assets of the Master Fund are 
considered for the purposes of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and Section 4975 
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), to 
be assets of employee benefit plans and other plans, the investments of the 
Master Fund may, in certain cases, be limited by such laws.  Trustees or 
administrators of tax-exempt entities should consult their own legal and 
tax advisors.  See “Investments by Benefit Plan Investors” below for more 
information. 
Financial Terms 
Organizational and 
Initial Offering Costs 
The Master Fund will pay (or reimburse the Investment Manager or its 
affiliates) for all organizational and initial offering costs of the Linonia 
Partners Funds including, but not limited to, all legal, accounting, printing 
and other expenses. 

The Master Fund is amortizing such costs for Gross Asset Value purposes 
in up to sixty (60) approximately equal monthly installments, beginning as 
of June 2023.  The Master Fund GP may, however, determine to accelerate 
such amortization over a shorter period (or all at once). 
Ongoing Operating 
Costs and Expenses 
The Master Fund generally pays all of the ongoing operating and offering 
costs of the Linonia Partners Funds including, but not limited to, 
transaction, accounting, auditing, administrative, custody, transfer, 
reporting, tax, regulatory, and legal fees and expenses, as well as any 
unanticipated or non-recurring costs and expenses (such as taxes, litigation 
or settlement costs, and indemnification expenses, if any). 

In general, all of the ongoing operating costs and expenses of the Linonia 
Partners Funds are aggregated and allocated among the Master Fund 
Accounts pro rata in accordance with their respective Net Asset Values, 
irrespective of whether a particular cost or expense was incurred solely or 
disproportionately by one or fewer than all Linonia Partners Funds.  
However, if the Master Fund GP determines that a material cost or expense 
relates solely or disproportionately to only one or fewer than all Linonia 
Partners Funds, the Master Fund GP may, but is not obligated to, specially 
allocate such cost or expense solely or disproportionately to the Master 
Fund Accounts attributable to such Linonia Partners Fund(s). 

None of the Linonia Partners Funds bear any of the internal overhead 
expenses of the Master Fund GP or the Investment Manager (such as 
salaries, bonuses or office rent). 

See “Fees and Expenses; Performance Allocations” below for more 
detailed information regarding the costs and expenses payable by the 
Master Fund.

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-11- 
“Soft Dollars” 
The Master Fund may bear the costs of certain products and services 
received by the Investment Manager that constitute “brokerage and 
research services” under Section 28(e) (“Section 28(e)”) of the U.S. 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The 
Master Fund may pay for these products and services directly and/or 
through “soft dollar” arrangements if the Investment Manager reasonably 
believes such arrangements fall within the “safe harbor” for “bona fide 
research services” established by Section 28(e). Such products and 
services may benefit Other Accounts in addition to the Fund. 
Monthly Management 
Fee 
Each Shareholder holding a Sub-Series of Shares is subject to a monthly 
management fee (“Management Fee”), calculated and paid to the 
Investment Manager monthly in advance, equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of a 
percentage (the “Applicable Percentage”) of the Gross Asset Value of 
each Shareholder’s Sub-Series.   

The Management Fee is calculated and paid at the Master Fund level based 
on the Master Fund Account balance attributable to each Shareholder’s 
Sub-Series.  If a Shareholder holds more than one Sub-Series of Shares 
subject to different Management Fee terms, the Management Fee is 
calculated separately in respect of each of the Master Fund Account 
balances corresponding to each such Sub-Series. 
Management Fee Calculation for Founders Shares 
If the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value is equal to or less than $1 
billion, the Applicable Percentage for Founders Shares equals 1.00% (a 
0.0833% monthly rate). 

If the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value exceeds $1 billion, the 
Applicable Percentage for Founders Shares is determined by applying a 
1.00% per annum rate to the Master Fund’s first $1 billion in aggregate 
Net Asset Value, and a reduced 0.50% per annum rate to the Master Fund’s 
aggregate Net Asset Value in excess of $1 billion, in accordance with the 
following formula (where “X” equals the Master Fund’s aggregate Net 
Asset Value):   

(($1BN x 1.00%) + ((X-$1BN) x 0.50%)) / X = the Applicable 
Percentage. 

For example (and solely for illustrative purposes), if the Master Fund’s 
aggregate Net Asset Value equals $3 billion, the Applicable Percentage 
would be 0.6667% (a 0.05556% monthly rate):  

(($1BN x 1.00%) + (($3BN-$1BN) x 0.50%)) / $3BN = 0.6667%.

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-12- 
Monthly Management 
Fee (cont.) 
For the avoidance of doubt, Series A1 Founders Shares and Series A2 
Founders Shares are subject to the same Management Fee rate (as 
described above), and the Master Fund’s Net Asset Value for purposes of 
calculating Management Fees is based on the Master Fund’s overall Net 
Asset Value (and not just the Net Asset Value attributable to the Series A1 
Founders Shares and/or Series A2 Founders Shares). 
Management Fee Calculation for Series B1 Shares 
The Applicable Percentage for Series B1 Shares equals 1.25% (a 0.1042% 
monthly rate). 
Management Fee Calculation for Series B2 Shares and Series B3 
Shares 
The Applicable Percentage for Series B2 Shares and Series B3 Shares 
equals 1.00% (a 0.0833% monthly rate), except that Shareholders holding 
Series B2 Shares or Series B3 Shares that have made Net Subscriptions (as 
defined below) of greater than $250 million, will be credited with a 
Management Fee step-down if the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset 
Value attributable to fee paying investors is greater than $6.5 billion. 

In such event, the Applicable Percentage for Series B2 Shares and Series 
B3 Shares for Shareholders who have made Net Subscriptions to the Fund 
greater than $250 million in the aggregate is determined by applying a 
1.00% per annum rate to the Master Fund’s first $6.5 billion in aggregate 
Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors, and a reduced 0.75% 
per annum rate to the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value 
attributable to fee paying investors in excess of $6.5 billion, in accordance 
with the following formula (where “X” equals the Master Fund’s 
aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors): 

Series B2 Shares and Series B3 Shares with Net Subscriptions of greater 
than $250 million 
(($6.5BN x 1.00%) + ((X-$6.5BN) x 0.75%)) / X = the Applicable 
Percentage. 

A Shareholder’s “Net Subscriptions” equal the cost amount of all of its 
Subscriptions minus the amount of all of its Redemptions calculated 
without regard to any intervening appreciation or depreciation.

Monthly Management 
Fee (cont.) 
Management Fee Calculation for Series C1 Shares 
The Applicable Percentage for Series C1 Shares equals 1.00% (a 0.0833% 
monthly rate), subject to the C Series Step-Down or the C Series 
Accelerated Step-Down (each as defined below).  
Eligibility.  In order to be eligible for the C Series Step-Down, a 
Shareholder must make Net Subscriptions of greater than $250 million 
across all series of Shares within seven years following such Shareholder’s 
initial investment in the Fund.  In order to be eligible for the C Series 
Accelerated Step-Down, a Shareholder must make Net Subscriptions of 
greater than $350 million across all series of Shares within seven years 
following such Shareholder’s initial investment in the Fund. 
Application.  A Shareholder that is eligible for the C Series Step-Down 
will be credited with a Management Fee step-down if (x) such Shareholder 
has made Net Subscriptions across all series of Shares of greater than $250 
million or holds Shares that have a market value of greater than $350 
million and (y) the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value attributable 
to fee paying investors is greater than $6.5 billion (the “C Series Step-
Down”).  A Shareholder that is eligible for the C Series Accelerated Step-
Down will be credited with an “accelerated” Management Fee step-down 
if (x) such Shareholder has made Net Subscriptions across all series of 
Shares of greater than $500 million or holds Shares that have a market 
value of greater than $500 million and (y) the Master Fund’s aggregate Net 
Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors is greater than $3.5 billion 
(the “C Series Accelerated Step-Down”).  For the avoidance of doubt, 
upon reaching either $250 million or $350 million in Net Subscriptions 
within the seven year timeframe from a Shareholder’s initial subscription, 
such Shareholder, for as long as it remains invested in the Fund, will obtain 
eligibility for the C Series Step-Down or the C Series Accelerated Step-
Down, respectively.  However, the application of each of the C Series 
Step-Down or the C Series Accelerated Step-Down, as of each date a 
Management Fee is calculated and charged, will depend on the satisfaction 
of both of the relevant foregoing provisions (x) and (y).  
The Applicable Percentage for Series C1 Shares subject to a C Series Step-
Down is determined by applying a 1.00% per annum rate to the Master 
Fund’s first $6.5 billion in aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee 
paying investors, and a reduced 0.75% per annum rate to the Master Fund’s 
aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors in excess of 
$6.5 billion, in accordance with the following formula (where “X” equals 
the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying 
investors): 
Series C1 Shares under the C Series Step-Down  
(($6.5BN x 1.00%) + ((X-$6.5BN) x 0.75%)) / X = the Applicable 
Percentage

Monthly Management 
Fee (cont.) 
The Applicable Percentage for Series C1 Shares subject to a C Series 
Accelerated Step-Down is determined by applying a 1.00% per annum rate 
to the Master Fund’s first $3.5 billion in aggregate Net Asset Value 
attributable to fee paying investors, and a reduced 0.75% per annum rate 
to the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying 
investors in excess of $3.5 billion, in accordance with the following 
formula (where “X” equals the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value 
attributable to fee paying investors): 
Series C1 Shares under the C Series Accelerated Step-Down  
(($3.5BN x 1.00%) + ((X-$3.5BN) x 0.75%)) / X = the Applicable 
Percentage. 
Performance 
Allocations  
The Shares are subject to Performance Allocations determined pursuant to 
the different calculation methodologies as summarized below. 

Series A1 Founders Shares, Series B1 Shares and Series B2 Shares 
Each Shareholder’s Sub-Series of Series A1 Founders Shares, Series B1 
Shares and Series B2 Shares is subject to a 20% annual Performance 
Allocation based on the amount by which new appreciation achieved by 
such series (calculated on a high water mark basis) exceeds a 6% 
cumulative hurdle amount. Series A1 Founders Shares are subject to, in 
some instances, a clawback for negative performance in the following 
fiscal year.  

Series A2 Founders Shares, Series B3 Shares and Series C1 Shares 
Each Shareholder’s Sub-Series of Series A2 Founders Shares, Series B3 
Shares and Series C1 Shares is subject to a 20% Performance Allocation 
based on the amount by which such series outperforms a hypothetical rate 
of return of the MSCI ACWI Net Total Return USD Index (i.e., Bloomberg 
Ticker: NDUEACWF Index). Series A2 Founders Shares are subject to, in 
some instances, a clawback for Underperformance in the following fiscal 
year. 

Performance Allocations are calculated and made at the Master Fund level 
in respect of the Master Fund Account corresponding to each 
Shareholder’s Sub-Series of Shares. 

The Performance Allocation methodologies applicable to the Shares are 
complex, and set forth in greater detail below under the section captioned 
“Fees and Expenses; Performance Allocations — Performance 
Allocations.”

Redemptions 
Redemptions 
Subject to the applicable Monthly Redemption Allowance (as described 
below), a Shareholder generally may redeem Shares (a “Redemption”) as 
of the end of each calendar month (a “Redemption Date”) upon at least 
(x) sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, with respect to Founders Shares, 
and (y) ninety (90) days’ prior written notice, with respect to B Shares or 
C Shares. 
Lock-Up Period for C 
Shares 
The C Shares are subject to a “hard” lock-up period that begins on the 
Subscription Date of a Shareholder’s initial subscription to the Fund for C 
Shares and ends on the twenty-fourth (24th) month-end following such 
Subscription Date, during which time such Shareholder will not be 
permitted to make a Redemption in respect of its C Shares (the “C Shares 
Lock-Up Period”).  
Monthly Redemption 
Allowance 
The maximum amount a Shareholder can redeem from the Fund as of any 
monthly Redemption Date equals the “Monthly Redemption Allowance” 
in effect for such Redemption Date. 
Initially, with respect to Founders Shares, a Shareholder’s Monthly 
Redemption Allowance equals one-twelfth (1/12) of such Shareholder’s 
Founders Shares.  If a Shareholder redeems the maximum 1/12 Monthly 
Redemption Allowance of its Founders Shares as of a Redemption Date, 
such Shareholder’s maximum Monthly Redemption Allowance is 
increased to 1/11, 1/10, 1/9, 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1/1 of the 
remaining Founders Shares as of the next eleven Redemption Dates on 
which such Shareholder redeems capital, respectively, which need not be 
consecutive Redemption Dates, subject to, in each case, the Redemption 
Reset (as defined below). 

Initially, with respect to B Shares, a Shareholder’s Monthly Redemption 
Allowance equals one-twenty-fourth (1/24) of such Shareholder’s B 
Shares.  If a Shareholder redeems the maximum 1/24 Monthly Redemption 
Allowance of its B Shares as of a Redemption Date, such Shareholder’s 
maximum Monthly Redemption Allowance is increased to 1/23, 1/22, 
1/21, 1/20, 1/19, 1/18, 1/17, 1/16, 1/15, 1/14, 1/13, 1/12, 1/11, 1/10, 1/9, 
1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1/1 of the remaining B Shares as of the 
next twenty-three Redemption Dates on which such Shareholder redeems 
capital, respectively, which need not be consecutive Redemption Dates, 
subject to, in each case, the Redemption Reset.

maximum 1/18 Monthly Redemption Allowance of its C Shares as of a 
Redemption Date, such Shareholder’s maximum Monthly Redemption 
Allowance is increased to 1/17, 1/16, 1/15, 1/14, 1/13, 1/12, 1/11, 1/10, 
1/9, 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1/1 of the remaining C Shares as of 
the next seventeen Redemption Dates on which such Shareholder redeems 
capital, respectively, which need not be consecutive Redemption Dates, 
subject to, in each case, the Redemption Reset. 

However, if a Shareholder (i) does not redeem any Shares for three 
consecutive Redemption Dates; (ii) redeems less than the applicable 
maximum Monthly Redemption Allowance in effect for a particular 
Redemption Date; or (iii) makes a new subscription to the Fund, the 
Monthly Redemption Allowance will remain at or be “reset” to 1/12 of 
such Shareholder’s remaining Founders Shares, 1/24 of such 
Shareholder’s remaining B Shares or 1/18 of such Shareholder’s remaining 
C Shares, as applicable (the “Redemption Reset”). 

The Monthly Redemption Allowance has been designed to permit a 
Shareholder to fully redeem (i) such Shareholder’s Founders Shares over 
the course of twelve (12) monthly Redemption Dates, (ii) such 
Shareholder’s B Shares over the course of twenty-four (24) monthly 
Redemption Dates or (iii) such Shareholder’s C Shares over the course of 
eighteen (18) monthly Redemption Dates following the conclusion of the 
C Shares Lock-Up Period, as applicable, in approximately equal amounts 
(i.e., approximately 1/12 or 8.33% of the number of Founders Shares, 
approximately 1/24 or 4.17% of the number of B Shares or approximately 
1/18 or 5.56% of the number of C Shares, as applicable, held by such 
Shareholder, determined as of the first Redemption Date), but without 
requiring such Redemption to be made over the course of twelve, twenty-
four or eighteen consecutive Redemption Dates, as applicable.  A 
Shareholder may elect not to redeem any Shares as of any one or any two 
consecutive Redemption Dates without triggering the Redemption Reset, 
but not three or more consecutive Redemption Dates. 

If a Shareholder holds multiple series of Shares, redemptions will be made 
from the series of Shares so designated by the redeeming Shareholder or, 
in the absence of such election, on a “first in, first out” or pro rata basis, 
as determined by the Investment Manager. 

See the section captioned “Redemptions,” below, for a more detailed 
description of the Monthly Redemption Allowance.

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-17- 
Key Person Events 
Upon the occurrence of a Key Person Event (as defined below), all 
Shareholders will be promptly notified and given the option — which must 
be exercised within thirty (30) days of receiving such notice (the “Key 
Person Event Notice Deadline”) — to redeem all or any portion of such 
Shareholder’s Shares without being subject to the applicable Monthly 
Redemption Allowance limitation or the C Shares Lock-Up Period (if 
applicable). Such Redemptions shall be effective as of the first calendar 
month-end that is at least twenty-five (25) days following the Key Person 
Notice Event Deadline. 

A “Key Person Event” will occur if the Principal (i) dies, (ii) is unable, 
by reason of illness or injury, to perform his functions for the Investment 
Manager for a period of 45 days during any consecutive 180-day period, 
(iii) for any reason other than death, illness or injury, ceases to devote 
substantially all of his business time to the day-to-day activities of the 
Investment Manager (which, for the avoidance of doubt, would not be 
triggered by reasonable vacation time) or (iv) is no longer primarily 
responsible for the management of the Fund’s portfolio. 

Key Person Event Redemptions are not subject to the Monthly 
Redemption Allowance or the C Shares Lock-Up Period (if applicable), 
but remain subject to all other terms applicable to Redemptions generally 
(except as otherwise specifically set forth above with respect to Key 
Person Event Redemptions). 
Payment of 
Redemption Proceeds 
Redemption proceeds are generally paid within thirty (30) days of the 
applicable Redemption Date or as soon as reasonably practicable 
thereafter; provided, that the Fund may, but has no obligation to, “hold 
back” up to 5% of the total estimated Redemption proceeds otherwise 
payable to a Shareholder in respect of Redemptions made during a single 
fiscal year until the completion of the Fund’s annual audit for the fiscal 
year in which the Redemption was effective. The Fund generally does not 
intend to retain an audit holdback of estimated Redemption proceeds 
unless a Shareholder has redeemed a substantial majority of its Shares 
during a particular fiscal year, but may (or may not) do so under any 
circumstance in its discretion. 

Redemption proceeds (including any “holdback”) are held as a general 
asset of the Fund pending payment and do not participate in the profits or 
losses of the Fund following the applicable Redemption Date, nor do they 
accrue any interest.   
Suspending the 
Determination of Net 
Asset Value, 
Redemption Dates or 
Payments 
The Directors may suspend the determination of Net Asset Value, 
Redemption Dates and/or the payment of Redemption proceeds if the 
Directors determine, among other reasons, it is not reasonably practicable 
for the Fund or the Master Fund to value a material portion of its assets, or 
if not doing so would be prejudicial to the Fund or could have a material 
adverse

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-18- 
Mandatory 
Redemptions 
The Directors may require a Shareholder to redeem from the Fund at any 
time, in whole or in part, for any or no reason.   
Dividends 
The Fund may pay dividends (“Dividends”) if the Master Fund makes a 
distribution to the Fund, although the Directors presently do not intend to 
cause the Fund to do so.  Dividends, if paid, need not be paid pro rata to 
all Shareholders.   

Any Dividend paid to a Shareholder decreases the Net Asset Value of such 
Shareholder’s Sub-Series and is treated as a Redemption for Performance 
Allocation purposes.   
Transfers 
A Shareholder may not pledge, sell, assign, exchange, transfer or 
otherwise dispose of (“Transfer”) all or part of its Shares without the 
written consent of, and on terms acceptable to, the Investment Manager.  

Transfers to new beneficial owners generally will be treated as a 
Redemption by the transferor (subject to a Performance Allocation, if due) 
and a new Subscription by the transferee.  The foregoing will result in the 
resetting of the C Shares Lock-Up Period for transfers of C Shares, such 
that the transferee’s C Shares will be subject to a new C Shares Lock-Up 
Period.  However, the Investment Manager may determine to treat the 
transferee as if it were the alter ego of the transferor for one or more 
purposes (including in respect of Performance Allocations) and generally 
intends to do so upon request if the transferee is a “Related Investor” (as 
determined by the Investment Manager in its sole discretion). 

Upon a Transfer, unless such Transfer is made to a Related Investor, 
Founders’ Shares will lose their classification as such, and the transferred 
Shares will be converted (by way of redemption and subscription) into 
(and become subject to the terms, including Management Fees and 
Performance Allocations applicable to) a Sub-Series of the series of B 
Shares corresponding to the Founders Shares held by the transferor as of 
the Transfer date, as determined by the Investment Manager.  

See “Redemptions,” below, for more detailed information regarding the 
liquidity terms applicable to the Shares. 
General 
Fiscal Year 
December 31. 
Periodic Reports 
The Investment Manager generally intends to provide to each Shareholder: 
(i) a month-end, unaudited, net performance estimate for the Fund; (ii) a 
monthly investor statement including the unaudited closing Net Asset 
Value of such Shareholder’s Sub-Series; and (iii) such other information 
at such times as the Investment Manager may deem appropriate.

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-19- 
Audited Financial 
Reports 
Shareholders receive audited annual financial statements of the Fund.  

The Investment Manager generally expects that the Fund’s audited 
financial statements with respect to a given fiscal year will be available 
within one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of such fiscal 
year.  There can, however, be no assurance as to when such financial 
statements will be available (as unforeseeable circumstances could arise 
that delay completion of an audit).   

The Fund’s audited financial statements are prepared in accordance with 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).  The Fund’s 
Gross Asset Values and Net Asset Values are also generally calculated in 
accordance with GAAP.  However, such Gross Asset Values and Net Asset 
Values for purposes of Redemptions, Management Fees, Performance 
Allocations and other Fund (and Master Fund) purposes may contain 
certain non-GAAP components, such as the amortization of organizational 
and initial offering costs. 
Tax Status 
The Master Fund and the Fund generally will not be subject to U.S. federal 
income taxation on their investing or trading activities, other than 
withholding tax on certain U.S. source dividends, dividend equivalent 
payments, interest and other fixed or determinable annual or periodical 
gains, profits and income received.  See “Certain Tax Considerations — 
United States — The Master Fund and the Fund.” 

The Government of the Cayman Islands does not, under existing 
legislation, impose any income, corporate or capital gains tax, estate duty, 
inheritance tax, gift tax or withholding tax upon the Fund, the Master Fund 
or the Shareholders.  The Cayman Islands are not party to a double tax 
treaty with any country that is applicable to any payments made to or by 
the Fund or the Master Fund. 

Certain investing and trading activities of the Master Fund may be subject 
to taxation in certain other jurisdictions. 

Shareholders are not to construe the contents of this Memorandum or any 
prior or subsequent communications from the Fund, the Master Fund or 
the Investment Manager as tax or legal advice.  Shareholders are urged to 
consult with their professional advisors to determine the tax, legal and 
financial consequences of the holding and disposition of Shares.  Further 
information is contained under the section captioned “Certain Tax 
Considerations,” below. 
Prime Broker to the 
Master Fund 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (the “Prime Broker”).  The Master Fund GP 
may select one or more additional or substitute prime brokers for the 
Master Fund in the future.  The Prime Broker is compensated for its 
services pursuant to the terms of its engagement.  The Prime Broker is 
regulated by the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (the 
“FINRA”).

SUMMARY 
(cont.) 
-21- 
Risk Factors 
The Shares are a speculative and illiquid investment that involve a 
high degree of risk.  There can be no assurance that the Fund will 
achieve its objective, and investors could lose all or substantially all of 
their investment in the Fund.  Among the risks which prospective 
investors should note are the following: 

● The Investment Manager and the Fund have limited operating and 
performance history as of the date of this Memorandum.  An 
investment in the Fund is subject to all of the risks associated with 
“start-up” operations.  

● The Fund’s performance can be expected to be volatile, particularly 
given that the Fund’s portfolio is generally expected to be highly 
concentrated in a limited number of equity securities.   

● The Shares are not freely transferable and are subject to 
restrictions on Redemptions (including the Monthly Redemption 
Allowance).  There is no secondary market for the Shares, and none 
will develop. 

● The Fund is subject to substantial fees and expenses, which will 
reduce the Fund’s capital unless offset by profits. 

● The Investment Manager has discretionary trading authority over 
the Master Fund.  The use of a single investment adviser reduces 
diversification and, consequently, increases risk. 

● The Fund, the Master Fund GP and the Investment Manager are 
subject to actual as well as potential conflicts of interest. 

● The Fund and the Master Fund are not subject to the same 
regulatory requirements as regulated U.S. investment companies 
(e.g., mutual funds) or any other comparable system of regulation.

- THE FUND’S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY

#### Conteúdo Textual
```
-22- 
THE FUND’S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY 
Investment Objective  
The Fund’s objective is to generate attractive absolute total returns over the long-term, and through 
multiple economic cycles, while minimizing the risk of permanent impairment of capital.     
The Fund attempts to achieve its objective by acquiring concentrated positions in a small number 
of high-quality companies that the Investment Manager believes have the potential, over a multi-year 
holding period, to appreciate significantly in value. Usually, these companies fit into long-lived investment 
themes that the Investment Manager assesses are conducive to long-term compounding. Such themes can 
include vertical market software, marketplaces, unique media content, aerospace, restaurant brands / 
“QSR”, consumer brands, and financial services, among others. The Investment Manager conducts deep 
fundamental research into its industries to identify the best expressions of these themes and develop a point 
of view about what target companies may be worth 5+ years in the future. The Investment Manager 
generally favors monopolistic businesses (businesses that either have a dominant market position or are 
likely to have an increasingly dominant market position in the future) as well as unique franchises which 
tend to exhibit many of the same economic characteristics as monopoly businesses. In addition, the 
Investment Manager generally prizes companies that compete in attractive end markets and enjoy 
significant growth potential in those end markets. The Investment Manager also favors companies with 
high revenue retention and low customer churn, though these characteristics are not a prerequisite for 
investment.  
Although the Investment Manager may short-sell securities it believes are either over-valued or 
could serve as a hedge within the portfolio, the Fund is generally expected to have a significant long bias. 
The Fund generally invests primarily in equity securities that are listed and traded on internationally 
recognized exchanges. However, the Investment Manager also searches for opportunities in a broad range 
of securities and asset classes, and the Fund may also invest in other levels of a company’s capital structure 
such as senior or subordinated debt as well as certain other securities such as credit default swaps, tradable 
bank loans, exchange-traded funds, options and indexes.   
Investment Strategy  
Private Equity in the Public Markets.  The Fund applies a “private equity” lens to the public 
markets. The Investment Manager conducts fundamental research to identify companies whose long-term 
prospects it believes may be under-appreciated by public markets investors. Although the Fund generally 
invests in marketable securities, and in practice owns only a small percentage of each company in which it 
invests, it generally evaluates each investment as though it were to own the entire company over the long-
term. 
The Investment Manager favors the f

 
Attractive market structures and end markets; 
 
Substantial free cash flow generation; 
 
High returns on invested capital (or the potential for returns on capital to improve 
significantly); 
 
Wide (and/or widening) competitive moats; 
 
Significant pricing power; and 
 
Appropriate capital structures. 
Concentration and Holding Periods 
In order to concentrate the Fund’s capital in investments that the Investment Manager believes offer 
the highest risk-adjusted returns, the Fund’s portfolio is generally expected to be concentrated in between 
five (5) and fifteen (15) “long” positions, with the majority of the Fund’s portfolio typically invested in five 
(5) to ten (10) “high conviction” core positions that the Investment Manager believes to have the potential 
to rise substantially in value over a three (3) to five (5) year time frame (although actual holding periods 
may be longer or shorter depending on the Investment Manager’s ongoing assessment of the Fund’s 
positions). Accordingly, the Fund is not broadly diversified. Although the Fund has no formal concentration 
limits or diversification requirements, the Investment Manager generally does not intend to acquire 
positions that exceed twenty-five percent (25%), or constitute less than four percent (4%), of the Fund’s 
aggregate Net Asset Value at the time of acquisition (other than in limited circumstances, such as where 
the Fund is in the initial stages of acquiring or closing out a stake in a particular position).  
While a concentrated portfolio is conventionally viewed as higher risk (as compared to a more 
broadly diversified portfolio), the Investment Manager believes concentration can also have the opposite 
effect because the Fund’s portfolio will be significantly weighted towards the highest conviction ideas 
whose potential risks and rewards have been carefully analyzed (although there can be no assurance the 
Investment Manager’s assessments will be correct or that unanticipated circumstances and events will not 
arise). The majority of the Fund’s portfolio will typically be invested in core positions that the Investment 
Manager believes to have the greatest potential to rise substantially in value. Usually this means the 
Investment Manager will target investments that the Investment Manager believes can generate attractive 
compound annual returns over at least a three (3) to five (5) year time horizon. 
In addition to the Fund’s portfolio exposure being concentrated primarily in a limited number of 
equity securities, the Fund’s exposure also may be concentrated in various other respects, including, but 
not limited to, being concentrated in one or more industry or market sector.   
Short Selling 
Although the Fund’s portfolio is generally expected to have a significant “long” bias, the 
Investment Manager may from time to time short-sell securities that it believes are overvalued.  The 
Investment Manager may also use short positions to hedge against a s

increases both the proportionate amount of potential gain, as well as potential loss, relative to the Fund’s 
equity capital. If the value of a margin position declines, the securities serving as collateral for such margin 
position may be liquidated, resulting in a loss proportionately greater than would be the case absent such 
use of leverage. The Shareholders’ liability is limited to their investment in the Fund. 
Cash Equivalent Investments 
The Investment Manager intends to concentrate the Fund’s portfolio in investments the Investment 
Manager believes are particularly attractive and have the potential to achieve significant gains over a longer-
term holding period. From time to time, a significant portion of the Fund’s portfolio may consist of cash or 
cash equivalents, such as money market funds, pending the identification of opportunities that meet the 
Investment Manager’s investment criteria for the Fund. 
No Formal Investment Restrictions 
Although the Investment Manager currently anticipates that the Fund’s primary investment focus 
will be on publicly-traded securities traded in the developed markets, the Fund may from time to time invest 
in or generate exposure to other types of securities or financial instruments, as well as invest in less 
developed and emerging markets. There are no formal limitations on the markets, financial instruments or 
geographies in which the Fund may trade, and the Fund is not subject to any formal diversification 
requirements or concentration limits. 
Relationships with Portfolio Companies 
As of the date of this Memorandum, the Fund has not acquired investment positions with the 
intention of seeking control or the ability to influence the management of a particular issuer. Depending on 
changes in economic conditions or other factors, the Fund may in the future seek control or influential 
positions with one or more issuers. In addition, there may be situations that, in the judgment of the 
Investment Manager, require active efforts to seek changes in particular management policies or strategies, 
or to change management itself. In such situations, the Investment Manager may, either alone or with other 
investors, make its views known to management and may seek to influence, in a manner consistent with 
the Fund’s investment objectives and resources, the management or policies of a particular issuer. 
Currency Hedging 
Shares are denominated, and the Fund and the Master Fund value their assets, in U.S. Dollars.  The 
Fund may offer Shares denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.  The Investment Manager 
may engage in currency hedging at the Master Fund level for and on behalf of the Fund as a whole as well 
as particular classes, tranches or series of Shares.  Any profits, losses and expenses associated with any 
currency hedging in respect of the Fund or any particular class, tranche or series of Shares, will be allocated 
solely to the Fund or such class, tranche or series of

Fund’s independent auditors) in conjunction with his or her office of Director on such terms as to tenure of 
office and otherwise as the Directors may determine.  Any Director also may act in a professional capacity 
(other than as the Fund’s independent auditors) and he or she (or his or her firm) will be entitled to 
remuneration for such services as if he or she were not a Director.  A Director may contract with the Fund; 
provided, that the Director declares his or her interest or gives notice of his or her interest as soon as 
practicable after the Director obtains such interest. 
A Director may vote or be counted in the quorum in respect of certain contracts in which the 
Director is materially interested other than as a Shareholder; provided, that such Director declares such 
interest prior to the taking of the vote. 
Directors’ Standard of Liability; Indemnification 
Each Director and officer of the Fund (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include any 
auditor), together with each former Director and former officer of the Fund (each an “Indemnified 
Person”), will be indemnified out of the assets of the Fund against any liability, action, proceeding, claim, 
demand, costs, damages or expenses, including legal expenses, whatsoever which they or any of them may 
incur as a result of any act or failure to act in carrying out their functions other than such liability (if any) 
that they may incur by reason of their own actual fraud, willful default or reckless or intentional misconduct.

The Master Fund GP does not have any employees.  Pursuant to the Investment Management 
Agreement, the Master Fund GP has delegated discretionary authority to the Investment Manager over 
the: (i) trading and investment activities of the Master Fund; and (ii) management of the business and affairs 
of the Master Fund, subject to the ultimate supervision of the Master Fund GP.  References to the Master 
Fund GP herein also refer to the Investment Manager acting on its behalf pursuant to such delegated 
authority unless the context otherwise requires.  
The Investment Manager  
The Linonia Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership affiliated with the Master Fund GP 
(the “Investment Manager”), serves as the investment adviser to the Fund and the other Linonia Partners 
Funds. 
The Fund’s Directors have delegated responsibility for the day-to-day operations and the 
investment decisions of the Fund to the Investment Manager pursuant to the Investment Management 
Agreement.  However, at the Fund level, the Investment Manager principally provides administrative and 
client-relations services, as the Fund is required to invest all of its capital in the Master Fund, except for 
such capital as the Investment Manager determines may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to pay any 
fees, expenses or other costs related to the Fund itself.  At the Master Fund level, the Investment Manager 
has been delegated plenary authority to direct the trading and investment activities of the Linonia Partners 
Funds.  References to the Investment Manager’s trading and investment activities on behalf of the Fund 
refer to the Fund’s investment in the Master Fund, and the trading and investment activities directed by the 
Investment Manager on behalf of the Master Fund. 
The Investment Manager is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers 
Act.  Status as a registered investment adviser with the SEC does not imply that the Investment Manager 
has achieved a certain level of skill or training nor does it require that any testing, capitalization or other 
mandated “fitness” requirements have been satisfied, as no such requirements apply.   
Although the Fund’s investment strategy may include trading in certain financial futures and 
derivatives, the Investment Manager is not required to register as a “commodity pool operator” with the 
CFTC with respect to the Fund pursuant to an exemption provided by CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3).  However, if 
the Investment Manager determines that it is in the best interests of the Fund to trade commodity interests 
to a greater extent than is permitted under the CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3) exemption, the Investment Manager 
may register with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor and become a 
member of the U.S. National Futures Association (the “NFA”) in such capacities. 
Such registrations and memberships in no respect indicate that the Investment Manager has 
achieved any level of ex

Mr. Philip Uhde, Founder and Managing Principal 
Philip Uhde is the founder and sole principal of the Master Fund GP and the Investment Manager.  
From January 2010 to June 2012, he was an associate at SPO Partners, an investment partnership founded 
by John Scully in 1971 that made concentrated, long-term investments in public and private equities.  From 
2012 to 2020, Mr. Uhde was the managing member and Chief Investment Officer of Echinus Advisers, 
LLC, a registered investment adviser that managed private funds making concentrated investments in the 
public equity markets.  
Mr. Uhde graduated in 2008 from Yale University with a B.A. in Economics and East Asian 
Studies.  Mr. Uhde shares the same business address as the Investment Manager. 
Standard of Liability; Indemnification 
The Investment Management Agreement sets forth in detail the liability and indemnification 
standards outlined below.  The following description only summarizes certain of the detailed provisions of 
the Articles and the Investment Management Agreement, the terms of which are controlling. 
The Investment Manager, its Affiliates and any of their respective owners, principals, partners, 
members, managers, directors, officers and employees (each, an “Investment Manager Party”, and 
collectively, the “Investment Manager Parties”) are not, absent conduct that is finally determined by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, in a ruling no longer subject to review or appeal (“Finally Determined”) 
to constitute fraud, gross negligence (having the meaning as defined under the laws of the State of Delaware, 
U.S.A.) or willful misconduct on their part, liable to the Fund or to any current or former Shareholder for 
any act or omission in the course of, or in connection with, the services rendered by them for or on behalf 
of the Fund or for any loss or damage which the Fund may sustain or suffer as a result (direct or indirect) 
of any such act or omission (the “Standard of Care”).  
The Investment Manager Parties are not liable for any tax or tax penalty imposed on the Fund or 
the Shareholders in any jurisdiction (irrespective of the reason that such tax or tax penalty is due, unless 
such tax or tax penalty is the direct result of conduct by Investment Manager Parties constituting fraud or 
bad faith).  Nor is any Investment Manager Party liable for any costs incurred in respect of any tax audit, 
similar procedure or tax position taken by such Investment Manager Party which was not clearly contrary 
to Law when taken. 
No Investment Manager Party will have any liability to the Fund, any shareholder or any former 
shareholder for conduct Finally Determined to have constituted a violation of law; provided, that such 
Investment Manager Party, after consultation with nationally recognized attorneys and/or accountants, as 
relevant, reasonably believed such conduct to be lawful and in the interests of the Fund at the time of such 
conduct. 
No Investment Manager Party bear

from conduct that is Finally Determined to violate the Standard of Care on their part) which may be imposed 
on, incurred by or asserted against any of them in performing their obligations or duties for or on behalf of 
the Fund.  The Fund may also agree to indemnify certain agents, advisors, consultants and service providers 
to a greater or lesser extent than its indemnification obligations to the Investment Manager Parties. 
The Fund will advance amounts and/or pay expenses as incurred in connection with the 
indemnification obligations set forth above; provided, that the Investment Manager Party receiving such 
advance payment agrees in writing to return such payment (without interest) if it is Finally Determined that 
such Investment Manager Party was not entitled to indemnification. 
The indemnification and exculpation provisions in the Investment Management Agreement 
described above will not be construed as a waiver of any rights of the Fund or the Master Fund or any 
Shareholder under U.S. federal or state securities laws.   
MUTUAL FUNDS ACT REGULATION 
The Fund is registered as a mutual fund pursuant to section 4(3) of the Mutual Funds Act (As 
Revised) of the Cayman Islands (“Mutual Funds Act”) and is therefore regulated as a mutual fund by the 
Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (the “Authority”).  As a section 4(3) mutual fund, the minimum initial 
investment purchasable by an investor is CI$80,000 (or its equivalent in another currency, approximately 
US$100,000). 
The Authority has supervisory and enforcement powers to ensure compliance with the Mutual 
Funds Act.  Regulation under the Mutual Funds Act entails the filing of prescribed details and audited 
accounts annually with the Authority.  As a regulated mutual fund, the Authority may at any time instruct 
the Fund to have its accounts audited and to submit them to the Authority within such time as the Authority 
specifies.  Failure to comply with these requests by the Authority may result in substantial fines on the part 
of the Directors of the Fund and may result in the Authority applying to the court to have the Fund wound 
up. 
The Fund will not, however, be subject to supervision in respect of its investment activities or the 
constitution of the Fund’s portfolio by the Authority or any other governmental authority in the Cayman 
Islands, although the Authority does have power to investigate the activities of the Fund in certain 
circumstances.  Neither the Authority nor any other governmental authority in the Cayman Islands has 
commented upon or approved the terms of this document or the merits of an investment in the Fund. There 
is no investment compensation scheme in the Cayman Islands available to investors. 
The Authority may take certain actions if it is satisfied that a regulated mutual fund is or is likely 
to become unable to meet its obligations as they fall due or is carrying on or is attempting to carry on 
business or is winding up its business volunt

The Administrator bases its computations on the assets and liabilities reported to the Administrator 
by the Fund, its prime brokers, custodians and Investment Manager.  The Administrator will assume that 
these assets and liabilities represent a complete record of the Fund’s investments as of the date of the Fund’s 
accounting statements as prepared by the Administrator.   
The Administrator in computing the net asset value of the Fund will use prices that are determined 
by the Fund in its sole discretion, and described in the Administration Agreement.  In particular, but without 
limitation, the Fund may specify pricing methodologies that the Administrator will rely upon (such as the 
prices of listed, liquid securities reported on exchanges and quoted by third-party vendors) or, alternatively, 
the Fund may direct the Administrator to accept valuations of securities and other assets from the 
Investment Manager. Pricing for privately held securities (and certain other Level 3 securities), if any, is 
generally provided by the Investment Manager. 
The prices of assets and liabilities used by the Administrator in computing the net asset value of 
the Fund may vary from prices that the Administrator uses in providing comparable services to other clients 
and from prices that affiliates of the Administrator use in connection with their customer or proprietary 
business.  The Administrator accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of any information supplied to it by 
the Fund or any of its authorised representatives (including, without limitation, the Investment Manager) 
and is under no obligation to verify this information.  
The Administrator is a service provider to the Fund and is not responsible for the information in, 
or preparation of, this Memorandum or the activities of the Fund and therefore accepts no responsibility for 
any information contained in this Memorandum.  Other than its review of whether investors have 
affirmatively provided representations in their subscription document noting their capacity to invest in the 
Fund, the Administrator makes no independent review of the capacity and authority of investors to invest 
in the Fund. The Administrator is not an auditor and does not provide tax, accounting or auditing advice, 
nor is it a fiduciary to the Fund, the Investment Manager or the Fund’s investors. The Administrator is not 
responsible for monitoring the Fund’s portfolio to determine whether the Fund is in compliance with the 
investment strategy, guidelines, restrictions, risk limits, and borrowing and leverage limits set forth in this 
Memorandum or as otherwise may be applicable to the Fund or the Investment Manager under applicable 
law; furthermore, the Administrator is not responsible for monitoring the Fund’s compliance with the terms 
of any side letter or similar investor specific agreements that may have been made, whether relating to 
liquidity, transparency, valuation, or otherwise. In processing wir

Morgan Stanley Fund Services (Ireland) Limited on such terms and conditions as the Administrator 
reasonably deems appropriate.  Shareholders may receive communications from, and direct 
communications to, Morgan Stanley Fund Services (Ireland) Limited.  The Fund is not authorized or 
supervised by regulatory authorities in Ireland.  The Administrator is licensed as a mutual fund 
administrator by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority under the Cayman Islands Mutual Funds Act (as 
may be amended from time to time) and as a consequence, is subject to supervision as a fund administrator 
by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. 
The Administrator is an indirect subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, a global financial services firm 
providing services in securities, investment management and credit services with more than 1,200 offices 
in 36 countries.  The Administrator conducts its fund administration business independently from the other 
financial services provided by Morgan Stanley and its affiliates. 

THE SHARES; FINANCIAL ALLOCATIONS 
General 
The Fund’s authorized share capital of $50,000 is divided into 49,900,000 participating, non-voting 
shares (the “Shares”), being redeemable participating shares of par value $0.001 each to be issued to 
investors, and 100 management shares (the “Management Shares”) being voting non-participating shares 
of par value $1.00 each, all of which have been issued and are held by the Investment Manager. 
The Fund initially offered Series A1 Founders Shares and Series A2 Founders Shares (together, 
“Founders Shares”) during a limited offering period that expired on June 30, 2024 (the “Founders 
Investment Period”), subject to the Founders Capacity Rights (as described below).  The Series A1 
Founders Shares and Series A2 Founders Shares are identical except that Series A1 Founders Shares and 
Series A2 Founders Shares are subject to Performance Allocations determined pursuant to different 
calculation methodologies, as summarized herein and set out in more detail under “Fees and Expenses; 
Performance Allocations — Performance Allocations” below.   
The Fund is currently offering Series B1 Shares (“Series B1 Shares”), Series B2 Shares (“Series 
B2 Shares”), Series B3 Shares (“Series B3 Shares”) (together, “B Shares”) and Series C1 Shares (“Series 
C1 Shares” or the “C Shares”).  
The series of Shares differ from each other with respect to their Redemption terms, Management 
Fee terms and certain aspects of their Performance Allocation terms (each as defined below). 
Investors may subscribe for only Series B1 Shares, Series B2 Shares, Series B3 Shares or Series 
C1 Shares, as well as subscribe for and hold multiple series of B Shares and the C Shares. 
The B Shares and C Shares are expected to be offered to prospective investors during a limited 
offering period which will expire on December 31, 2025 (the “B Shares Investment Period” and “C 
Shares Investment Period”, as applicable), subject to the B Shares C

more additional subscriptions for Founders Shares in an aggregate amount up to the amount of such 
Shareholder’s aggregate subscriptions for Founders Shares during the Founders Investment Period (the 
“Founders Capacity Rights”).  
Shareholders exercising their Founders Capacity Rights may subscribe for either Series A1 
Founders Shares or Series A2 Founders Shares (or both) at their election, irrespective of the amount of their 
aggregate subscriptions for Series A1 Founders Shares or Series A2 Founders Shares during the Founders 
Investment Period. 
B Shares Capacity Rights 
Any Shareholder issued B Shares in respect of such Shareholder’s initial Subscription to the Fund 
will have the right (but not the obligation), at any time prior to the twenty-fourth (24th) calendar month-
end following the Subscription Date on which such initial subscription was made, to make one or more 
additional subscriptions for B Shares in an aggregate amount up to the amount of such Shareholder’s 
aggregate subscriptions for B Shares during the B Shares Investment Period (the “B Shares Capacity 
Rights”). 
Shareholders exercising their B Shares Capacity Rights may subscribe for any of Series B1 Shares, 
Series B2 Shares or Series B3 Shares at their election, irrespective of the amount of their aggregate 
subscriptions for Series B1 Shares, Series B2 Shares or Series B3 Shares during the B Shares Investment 
Period. 
C Shares Capacity Rights 
Any Shareholder issued C Shares will have the right (but not the obligation), at any time after such 
Shareholder’s admission to the Fund, to make one or more additional subscriptions for C Shares in an 
aggregate amount up to $4 for each $1 that is invested during the C Shares Investment Period (the “C 
Shares Capacity Rights”).  By way of example (and solely for illustrative purposes), if a Shareholder’s 
aggregate Subscriptions during the C Shares Investment Period totals $150 million of Series C1 Shares, 
such Shareholder will be permitted to invest an additional amount of up to $600 million of Series C1 Shares 
in the aggregate over the duration of its time as a Shareholder. 
Additional Classes or Series of Shares 
The Fund may in the future offer one or more additional or customized classes or series of Shares 
on terms different from those of other classes or series which may include, but are not limited to, currency 
denominations, investment minimums, fee structures, liquidity, voting and distribution rights; provided, 
that the Investment Manager does not believe doing so will have a material adverse effect on existing 
Shareholders or violate applicable law or regulations.  
Except for the Founders Capacity Rights, the B Shares Capacity Rights and the C Shares Capacity 
Rights, the Fund may cease offering any class or series of Shares at any time without providing notice to, 
or receiving consent from, the Shareholders. 
General Financial Allocations  
The Fund will issue a separate Sub-Series of the applicable

share of the Fund’s net profits or losses, Management Fees, Performance Allocations to the Master Fund 
GP (if applicable), Subscriptions and Redemptions.  The Fund’s net profits and losses are allocated as of 
the last day of each calendar month among the Sub-Series in accordance with their Proportionate Shares as 
of the beginning of such month. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Shareholder subscribes for Shares subject to different terms, 
such Shareholder will be issued separate Sub-Series of each such series of Shares that will be accounted for 
separately as though they were held by different Shareholders (including for purposes of effectuating 
Redemptions and calculating Management Fees and Performance Allocations).  Similarly, if a Shareholder 
makes more than one subscription for the same series of Shares on different Subscription Dates, the Fund 
may issue a separate Sub-Series for purposes of accounting for each subscription separately, if and as set 
forth in the Memorandum or the applicable series supplement thereto. 
The Fund invests all of its capital in the Master Fund, except for such capital as the Investment 
Manager determines may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to pay any fees, expenses or other costs 
related to the Fund itself.  Accordingly, the Net Asset Value of a Shareholder’s Sub-Series will reflect the 
Net Asset Value of such Sub-Series’ pro rata interest in the Master Fund.   
Special Allocations 
Certain items of the Fund’s profits, losses, income, gain or expense may be specially allocated 
(“Special Allocations”) to certain but not all Shareholders, or on a basis other than pro rata in accordance 
with their respective Proportionate Shares.  Typically, Special Allocations result from applicable law (for 
example, certain Shareholders may be restricted from participating in gains and losses attributable to “new 
issues” — generally, initial public offerings of equity securities), withholding taxes (for example, the 
withholding tax imposed on the Master Fund with respect to U.S. source dividends that may not be 
applicable to the Master Fund’s Direct Investors or other Feeder Funds) or other considerations prohibiting 
certain Shareholders (even indirectly through investing in the Fund) from participating in certain 
transactions.  Shareholders restricted from participating in the profits and losses attributable to certain 
financial instruments will generally not be compensated by the Fund for the use of such Shareholders’ pro 
rata share of the capital used to acquire such instruments.   
Special Allocations may be made at the Fund or the Master Fund level.  
Master Fund Allocations 
In general, all accounting procedures and financial allocations are made at the Master Fund level 
(which are reflected in the Net Asset Value of each Shareholder’s Sub-Series of Shares).  In particular, all 
Management Fees and Performance Allocations are calculated and paid/made by the Master Fund (and not

Allocations being calculated, allocated and paid/made by or in respect of the Master Fund Account 
corresponding to such Shareholder’s Sub-Series of Shares, unless the context otherwise requires.   
FEES AND EXPENSES; PERFORMANCE ALLOCATIONS 
Organizational and Initial Offering Costs 
The Master Fund will pay (or reimburse the Investment Manager or its affiliates, as the case may 
be) for all organizational and initial offering costs of the Linonia Partners Funds (including, but not limited 
to, legal, accounting, printing, and other expenses). 
The Master Fund is amortizing such costs for Gross Asset Value purposes in up to sixty (60) 
approximately equal monthly installments, beginning as of June 2023.  While the amortization of 
organizational and initial offering expenses may not be in accordance with GAAP, the Master Fund GP 
believes that amortizing the Linonia Partners Funds’ start-up costs in this manner may be more equitable 
than requiring the initial investors to bear the entire burden of such costs.  The Master Fund GP may, 
however, determine to accelerate such amortization over a shorter period (or all at once) if it determines 
such costs are not significant compared to the overall capitalization of the Linonia Partners Funds.  The 
Master Fund will not amortize start-up costs to the extent that doing so will cause the Fund to receive a 
“qualified” audit report on the GAAP compliance of the Fund’s financial statements. 
If the Investment Manager or its affiliates organize another Feeder Fund to invest in the Master 
Fund, such Feeder Fund’s organizational expenses may be allocated to the Master Fund and amortized 
against the Master Fund’s Net Asset Value as a whole (thereby reducing the Net Asset Value of all Master 
Fund Accounts).  Although the Master Fund GP may determine to amortize such Feeder Fund’s 
organizational expenses solely or disproportionately against the Net Asset Value of the new Feeder Fund’s 
Master Fund Account, it has no obligation and currently does not intend to do so.   
Operating Expenses and Transaction Costs 
The Master Fund generally pays all of the ongoing operating and offering costs of the Linonia 
Partners Funds including, without limitation: (i) all investment related expenses including, without 
limitation, the following: the costs and expenses relating to the research, execution and monitoring of actual 
and prospective investments (whether or not consummated); third-party investment sourcing fees; 
consulting fees; expert fees, fees and expenses of and related to obtaining research, analytics and market 
data (including, without limitation, third-party data sources and any information technology hardware, 
software and data subscriptions (such as Bloomberg and FactSet) or other technology incorporated into the 
cost of obtaining such research and market data); due diligence expenses (including, without limitation, 
research-related travel expenses); any outsourced trading provider fees; b

expenses and the costs associated with the ongoing offering of the Linonia Partners Funds including, 
without limitation, the following: fees and the costs and expenses the Investment Manager determines are 
associated with the ongoing offering of the Linonia Partners Funds including, without limitation, preparing, 
updating and/or amending the Memorandum and the Material Contracts, costs incurred in connection with 
complying with private placement regimes such as Form D and blue sky filings, world sky matters and the 
European Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (if applicable) and similar fees and expenses; 
and preparing marketing brochures and “Due Diligence Questionnaires;” and such other costs and expenses 
the Investment Manager reasonably determines to be associated with the ongoing offering of the Linonia 
Partners Funds and the retention of capital; (iii) the general operating expenses of the Linonia Partners 
Funds including, without limitation, the following: costs and expenses associated with information 
technology hardware, software or other technology (including, without limitation, costs of software 
licensing, implementation, data management and recovery services and custom development) used to 
research investments, evaluate and manage risk, facilitate valuations and accounting functions, facilitate 
compliance with applicable laws or any self-regulatory organization (including reporting obligations);  
legal, accounting, auditing, consulting and other professional fees and expenses, including, without 
limitation, fees and expenses relating to the legal, tax and regulatory status of the Fund, the contractual and 
legal rights and obligations of the Fund with respect to its operations and investments, and audit and tax 
preparation; the fees and expenses of the “partnership representative;” administrative costs (including, 
without limitation, the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrator and its agents), establishing 
computer and systems connectivity with the Administrator and other third-party service providers, paying 
agency, transfer agency, accounting verification (if any) and/or investor registrar services and the costs of 
middle-office and back-office support as provided by the Administrator; due-diligence expenses related to 
maintaining service-provider relationships with the Linonia Partners Funds (including any travel-related

Parties obtaining and maintaining regulatory licenses as well as of maintaining U.S. and non-U.S. 
registration, regulatory and self-regulatory filings (including, without limitation, Forms 13D, 13F, 13G,

disproportionately by one or fewer than all Linonia Partners Funds.  Accordingly, the Master Fund’s Direct 
Investors will bear a portion of the Fund’s (and any other Feeder Fund’s) operating expenses that are 
unrelated to the Master Fund, and Shareholders will bear a portion of the Master Fund’s costs (as well as 
those of any other Feeder Fund) that are unrelated to the Fund or its investment in the Master Fund.  
However, the Master Fund GP may, but is not obligated to, specially allocate a material cost or expense 
incurred solely or disproportionately by one Linonia Partners Fund on a non-pro rata basis if the Master 
Fund GP determines doing so would be more equitable  (for example, a material expense incurred by the 
Fund that is unrelated to the Master Fund may be specially allocated to the Master Fund Accounts 
attributable to the Fund’s Shareholders; conversely, a material expense incurred by the Master Fund that is 
unrelated to the Fund or its investment in the Master Fund may be specially allocated among the Master 
Fund Accounts of Direct Investors).  The Fund is responsible for paying any fees and expenses allocated to 
and not paid by the Master Fund.  See “Certain Conflicts of Interest — Allocation of Expenses,” below. 
Neither the Fund nor the Master Fund pays any of the internal expenses of the Investment Manager 
(such as salaries, bonuses or office rent), except as may otherwise be set forth above. 
Management Fee 
The Management Fee is calculated and paid at the Master Fund level based on the Master Fund 
Account balance attributable to each Shareholder’s Sub-Series.  If a Shareholder holds more than one Sub-
Series of Shares subject to different Management Fee terms, the Management Fee is calculated separately 
in respect of each of the Master Fund Account balances corresponding to each such Sub-Series.  
The Investment Manager may waive, reduce, or modify the Management Fee with respect to certain 
Shareholders, without entitling any other Shareholder to a similar waiver, reduction or modification. 
Management Fee Calculation for Founders Shares. 
Each Shareholder holding a Sub-Series of Series A1 Founders Shares or Series A2 Founders Shares 
is subject to a monthly Management Fee, calculated and paid to the Investment Manager monthly in 
advance, equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of a percentage (the “Applicable Percentage”) of the Gross Asset 
Value of each Shareholder’s Sub-Series.  
If the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value is equal to or less than $1 billion, the Applicable 
Percentage for Founders Shares equals 1.00% (a 0.0833% monthly rate). 
If the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value exceeds $1 billion, the Applicable Percentage for 
Founders Shares is determined by applying a 1.00% per annum rate to the Master Fund’s first $1 billion in 
aggregate Net Asset Value, and a reduced 0.50% per annum rate to the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset 
Value in excess of $1 billion, in accordance with the following f

For the avoidance of doubt, Series A1 Founders Shares and Series A2 Founders Shares are subject 
to the same Management Fee rate (as described above), and the Master Fund’s Net Asset Value for purposes 
of calculating Management Fees is based on the Master Fund’s overall Net Asset Value (and not just the 
Net Asset Value attributable to the Series A1 Founders Shares and/or Series A2 Founders Shares). 
Management Fee Calculation for Series B1 Shares. 
The Applicable Percentage for Series B1 Shares equals 1.25% (a 0.1042% monthly rate). 
Management Fee Calculation for Series B2 Shares and Series B3 Shares. 
The Applicable Percentage for Series B2 Shares and Series B3 Shares equals 1.00% (a 0.0833% 
monthly rate), except that Shareholders holding Series B2 Shares or Series B3 Shares that have made Net 
Subscriptions of greater than $250 million, will be credited with a Management Fee step-down if the Master 
Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors is greater than $6.5 billion.  
In such event, the Applicable Percentage for Series B2 Shares and Series B3 Shares for 
Shareholders who have made Net Subscriptions to the Fund greater than $250 million in the aggregate is 
determined by applying a 1.00% per annum rate to the Master Fund’s first $6.5 billion in aggregate Net 
Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors, and a reduced 0.75% per annum rate to the Master Fund’s 
aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors in excess of $6.5 billion, in accordance with 
the following formula (where “X” equals the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee 
paying investors): 
Series B2 Shares and Series B3 Shares with Net Subscriptions of greater than $250 million 
(($6.5BN x 1.00%) + ((X-$6.5BN) x 0.75%)) / X = the Applicable Percentage. 
For example (and solely for illustrative purposes of the Applicable Percentage for the Series B2 
Shares and Series B3 Shares), if a Shareholder has made Net Subscriptions of $100 million for Series B2 
Shares, and the Master Fund’s Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors equals $10 billion, the 
Shareholder’s Applicable Percentage for its Management Fee would equal 1.00% (or 0.0833% per month).  
However, if that Shareholder had instead made Net Subscriptions of $300 million (with the Master Fund 
having the same Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors), the Shareholder’s Applicable 
Percentage for its Management Fee would equal 0.9125% per year (a 0.07604% monthly rate).  This would 
be calculated by using the following calculation, as the total amount of Net Asset Value of the Master Fund 
attributable to fee paying investors would exceed $6.5 billion by $3.5 billion:  
(($6.5BN x 1.00%) + (($10BN-$6.5BN) x 0.75%)) / $10BN = 0.9125%. 
Management Fee Calculation for Series C1 Shares. 
The Applicable Percentage for Series C1 Shares equals 1.00% (a 0.0833% monthly rate), subject

Application.  A Shareholder that is eligible for the C Series Step-Down will be credited with a 
Management Fee step-down if (x) such Shareholder has made Net Subscriptions across all series of Shares 
of greater than $250 million or holds Shares that have a market value of greater than $350 million and (y) 
the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors is greater than $6.5 billion 
(the “C Series Step-Down”).  A Shareholder that is eligible for the C Series Accelerated Step-Down will 
be credited with an “accelerated” Management Fee step-down if (x) such Shareholder has made Net 
Subscriptions across all series of Shares of greater than $500 million or holds Shares that have a market 
value of greater than $500 million and (y) the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee 
paying investors is greater than $3.5 billion (the “C Series Accelerated Step-Down”).  For the avoidance 
of doubt, upon reaching either $250 million or $350 million in Net Subscriptions within the seven year 
timeframe from a Shareholder’s initial subscription, such Shareholder, for as long as it remains invested in 
the Fund, will obtain eligibility for the C Series Step-Down or the C Series Accelerated Step-Down, 
respectively.  However, the application of each of the C Series Step-Down or the C Series Accelerated Step-
Down, as of each date a Management Fee is calculated and charged, will depend on the satisfaction of both 
of the relevant foregoing provisions (x) and (y).  
The Applicable Percentage for Series C1 Shares subject to a C Series Step-Down is determined by 
applying a 1.00% per annum rate to the Master Fund’s first $6.5 billion in aggregate Net Asset Value 
attributable to fee paying investors, and a reduced 0.75% per annum rate to the Master Fund’s aggregate 
Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors in excess of $6.5 billion, in accordance with the 
following formula (where “X” equals the Master Fund’s aggregate Net Asset Value attributable to fee 
paying investors): 
Series C1 Shares under the C Series Step-Down 
(($6.5BN x 1.00%) + ((X-$6.5BN) x 0.75%)) / X = the Applicable Percentage. 
For example (and solely for illustrative purposes of the C Series Step-Down), if a Shareholder never 
exceeded Net Subscriptions of $250 million for Series C1 Shares within seven years of its initial investment 
for C Shares, and the Master Fund’s Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors equals $8 billion, 
the Shareholder’s Applicable Percentage for its Management Fee would equal 1.00% (or 0.0833% per 
month).  However, if instead that Shareholder, having exceeded $250 million in Net Subscriptions within 
seven years of such Shareholder’s initial investment for C Shares, retains a level of Net Subscriptions over 
$250 million or such Shareholder’s C Shares have a market value of greater than $350 million (with the 
Master Fund having the same Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investo

For example (and solely for illustrative purposes of the C Series Accelerated Step-Down), if a 
Shareholder never exceeded Net Subscriptions of $350 million for Series C1 Shares within seven years of 
its initial investment for C Shares (or, having attained Net Subscriptions of greater than $350 million within 
seven years of such Shareholder’s initial investment for C Shares, such Shareholder maintains less than 
$500 million in Net Subscriptions, or the market value of such Shareholder’s C Shares is less than $500 
million), and the Master Fund’s Net Asset Value attributable to fee paying investors equals $6 billion, the 
Shareholder’s Applicable Percentage for its Management Fee would equal 1.00% (or 0.0833% per month).  
However, if that Shareholder had instead made Net Subscriptions of greater than $500 million after having 
made Net Subscriptions of greater than $350 million within seven years of such Shareholder’s initial 
investment for C Shares (or such Shareholder’s C Shares have a market value of greater than $500 million, 
after having made Net Subscriptions of greater than $350 million within seven years of such Shareholder’s 
initial investment for C Shares) (with the Master Fund having the same Net Asset Value attributable to fee 
paying investors), the Shareholder’s Applicable Percentage for its Management Fee would equal 0.896% 
per year (a 0.07465% monthly rate).  This would be calculated by using the following calculation, as the 
total amount of Net Asset Value of the Master Fund attributable to fee paying investors would exceed $3.5 
billion by $2.5 billion:  
(($3.5BN x 1.00%) + (($6BN-$3.5BN) x 0.75%)) / $6BN = 0.896%. 
Performance Allocations 
The Shares are subject to Performance Allocations determined pursuant to different calculation 
methodologies, as summarized below. Performance Allocations are calculated and made at the Master Fund 
level in respect of the Master Fund Account corresponding to each Shareholder’s Sub-Series of Shares. 
Performance Allocation for Series A1 Founders Shares, Series B1 Shares and Series B2 Shares. 
As of each December 31 and upon a Redemption (solely with respect to the Shares redeemed) or 
the termination of the Fund or the dissolution of the Master Fund, the Master Fund will calculate a 
“Performance Allocation” equal to 20% of the amount of any Hurdle Reduced New Appreciation (as 
defined below) that is attributable to the Master Fund Account corresponding to each Shareholder’s Sub-
Series of Series A1 Founders Shares, Sub-Series of Series B1 Shares and Sub-Series of Series B2 Shares. 
Series A1 Founders Shares are subject to, in some instances, a clawback for negative performance in the 
following fiscal year. 
Unless it is being calculated in connection with a Redemption, upon the calculation of a 
Performance Allocation for Series A1 Founders Shares, the Master Fund GP will be allocated 50% of such 
Performance Allocation as of the end of such Performance Allocation Calculatio

by the Shareholder from whom it was allocated until it is subject to a Series A1 Restricted Performance 
Allocation Reduction. Upon a Redemption from the Fund, the Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation 
for such year will not apply, and a full Performance Allocation will be allocated to the Master Fund GP at 
such time as described below.  
At each fiscal year-end (or upon the termination of the Fund or the dissolution of the Master Fund), 
the then current balance of the prior year’s Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation will be reduced 
by an aggregate amount (but not below zero) equal to the product of (x) the net depreciation for such Master 
Fund Account (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, the memorandum account) for such fiscal year (if any) 
and (y) 20%, subject to the limitation that such reduction shall not exceed the balance of the Series A1 
Restricted Performance Allocation as of such date (the “Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation 
Reduction”). If made, such reduction will be credited to the Master Fund Account from which the Series 
A1 Restricted Performance Allocation was originally made (and the Shareholder’s Shares attributable to 
such Master Fund Account) and such amounts will be subject to the terms of the Shareholder’s Shares in 
the Fund. Any amounts of the Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation that are not subject to a Series 
A1 Restricted Performance Allocation Reduction will be allocated to the Master Fund GP at such time. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Shareholder makes a Redemption from the Fund, a pro rata portion 
(based on the portion of the Master Fund Account balance indirectly withdrawn) of the balance of any 
Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation will be immediately allocated to the Master Fund GP without 
the application of a Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation Reduction. For the avoidance of doubt, 
no Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation Reduction will be applied to the portion of the Series A1 
Restricted Performance Allocation that is allocated to the Master Fund GP as a result of a Shareholder’s 
Redemption. 
For purposes of calculating the Performance Allocation in respect of the Master Fund Account 
corresponding to a Shareholder’s Sub-Series of Series A1 Founders Shares, Series B1 Shares and Series 
B2 Shares: 
“Hurdle Reduced New Appreciation” equals the positive difference between: (i) the amount of 
any New Appreciation attributable to a Master Fund Account; minus (ii) the Cumulative Hurdle Amount 
attributable to such Master Fund Account. 
“New Appreciation” equals the amount by which the Net Asset Value of a Master Fund Account 
(after reduction for all expenses including Management Fees, but prior to reduction for any accrued 
Performance Allocation) exceeds the High Water Mark attributable to such Master Fund Account. Any 
Fund expenses that are not allocated by the Fund to the Master Fund for payment (if any) reduce New 
Appreciation fo

The “Hurdle Amount” attributable to a Master Fund Account for each Fiscal Year accrues in equal 
monthly installments during such Fiscal Year, and is determined by (i) multiplying 1/12th of the Hurdle 
Rate by the Hurdle Rate Base in effect for such Fiscal Year; and (ii) adding such monthly amounts during 
such Fiscal Year (or portion thereof with respect to an intra-year Redemption). 
The “Hurdle Rate” equals 6%. 
The “Hurdle Rate Base” for each Fiscal Year equals the sum of (i) the High Water Mark; plus (ii) 
the Cumulative Hurdle Amount, in each case as of the beginning of such Fiscal Year. 
The “Cumulative Hurdle Amount” equals the sum of the Hurdle Amount accrued during each 
Fiscal Year (or portion thereof) since the last date on which a Performance Allocation was calculated. For 
the avoidance of doubt, if a Performance Allocation is calculated as of the end of a Fiscal Year, the 
Cumulative Hurdle Amount as of the beginning of the following Fiscal Year equals zero. 
The Cumulative Hurdle Amount is a “hard hurdle” — it is subtracted from New Appreciation in 
calculating whether there is any Hurdle Reduced New Appreciation. 
The High Water Mark (and, accordingly, the Hurdle Rate Base) is increased by the dollar amount 
of any additional capital contributions made to a Master Fund Account (corresponding to a Shareholder’s 
additional subscriptions for Series A1 Founders Shares, Series B1 Shares and Series B2 Shares) and are 
proportionately reduced upon a Redemption (as described below). As of the end of any Fiscal Year at which 
a Performance Allocation is calculated in respect of a Master Fund Account, the High Water Mark is reset 
to the Net Asset Value of such Master Fund Account after reduction by the amount of such Performance 
Allocation (including any Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation to be held in a memorandum 
account) and the Cumulative Hurdle Amount is reset to zero. Accordingly, the Investment Manager does 
not need to “earn back” Performance Allocations previously made in order to generate future Performance 
Allocations. 
Redemptions and Dividends 
If a Shareholder redeems Series A1 Founders Shares, Series B1 Shares or Series B2 Shares as of a 
date other than a December 31, a Performance Allocation is calculated and made to the Master Fund GP 
from the Master Fund Account corresponding to the applicable Sub-Series of Series A1 Founders Shares, 
Series B1 Shares or Series B2 Shares as if the Redemption Date had been a December 31, using the 
Cumulative Hurdle Amount accrued as of such Redemption Date. The Performance Allocation so 
calculated (if any) is multiplied by the fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is the 
Gross Asset Value of the amount being redeemed from the Master Fund Account and the denominator of 
which is the Gross Asset Value of such Master Fund Account immediately prior to such Redemption (the 
“Reduction Percentage”). Upon such Redemption, the High Water Mark, the Cum

intra-year Redemption is reduced to zero to avoid double counting (as such amount has been added to the 
Cumulative Hurdle Amount for purposes of calculating the Performance Allocation then made). 
Performance Allocation for Series A2 Founders Shares, Series B3 Shares and Series C1 Shares. 
As of the end of each Performance Allocation Calculation Period and upon a Redemption (solely 
with respect to the amount redeemed) or the termination of the Fund or the dissolution of the Master Fund, 
a Performance Allocation equal to 20% of: (i) any Outperformance, if any; minus (ii) any 
Underperformance Carryforward, that is attributable to the Master Fund Account corresponding to each 
Sub-Series of Series A2 Founders Shares, Sub-Series of Series B3 Shares and Sub-Series of Series C1 
Shares will be calculated. Series A2 Founders Shares are subject to, in some instances, a clawback for 
Underperformance in the following fiscal year. 
Unless it is being calculated in connection with a Redemption, upon the calculation of a 
Performance Allocation for Series A2 Founders Shares, the Master Fund GP will be allocated 50% of such 
Performance Allocation as of the end of such Performance Allocation Calculation Period. The other 50% 
of the Performance Allocation not allocated pursuant to the preceding sentence (the “Series A2 Restricted 
Performance Allocation”) will be retained in a memorandum account within the Master Fund and will be 
allocated to the account of the Master Fund GP as of the anniversary of the date of its calculation, subject 
to the following adjustments: (i) the Master Fund GP may take a Tax Distribution from the Series A2 
Restricted Performance Allocation pursuant to Section 4.5 of the Master Fund LPA to account for the 
Master Fund GP’s actual tax liability attributable to the establishment of the Series A2 Restricted 
Performance Allocation, (ii) the balance of the Series A2 Restricted Performance Allocation will be 
adjusted for net appreciation or net depreciation allocated to it by the Master Fund and (iii) any remaining 
balance of the Series A2 Restricted Performance Allocation will be subject to a Series A2 Restricted 
Performance Allocation Reduction as set forth below (if applicable). For the avoidance of doubt, (A) no 
amounts received as a Tax Distribution will be required to be repaid by the Master Fund GP or the 
Investment Manager Parties and (B) any Series A2 Restricted Performance Allocation retained in a 
memorandum account will not be permitted to be redeemed by the Shareholder from whom it was allocated 
until it is subject to a Series A2 Restricted Performance Allocation Reduction. Upon a Redemption from 
the Fund, the Series A2 Restricted Performance Allocation for such year will not apply, and a full 
Performance Allocation will be allocated to the Master Fund GP at such time as described below.

For purposes of calculating the Performance Allocation in respect of the Master Fund Account 
corresponding to a Shareholder’s Sub-Series of Series A2 Founders Shares, Series B3 Shares and Series 
C1 Shares: 
A “Performance Allocation Calculation Period” begins each January 1 and ends each December 
31 (or if a Master Fund Account is established after January 1, the period from the effective date of the 
corresponding Subscription and the immediately following December 31). 
“Index” means the MSCI ACWI Net Total Return USD Index (i.e., Bloomberg Ticker: 
NDUEACWF Index). 
“Base Amount” means the Net Asset Value of a Master Fund Account as of the beginning of each 
Performance Allocation Calculation Period. 
“Index Return” with respect to each Performance Allocation Calculation Period is the 
(hypothetical) amount that would have been gained (or lost) if the Net Asset Value of a Master Fund 
Account as of the beginning of the Performance Allocation Calculation Period had earned a rate of return 
equal to the rate of return of the Index during such Performance Allocation Calculation Period (i.e., the 
Base Amount multiplied by the percentage increase or decrease in the Index from the beginning to the end 
of such Performance Allocation Calculation Period). 
“Investor Return” with respect to each Performance Allocation Calculation Period equals the 
(actual) amount of net appreciation (or net depreciation) allocated to a Master Fund Account during such 
Performance Allocation Calculation Period (including both realized and unrealized gains and losses), after 
reduction for Management Fees and expenses (including at the Fund level), but prior to reduction for 
accrued Performance Allocations not yet made. 
If the Investor Return is greater than the Index Return, in each case as calculated from the beginning 
to the end of the current Performance Allocation Calculation Period, the difference equals 
“Outperformance.” Such Outperformance will be subject to a 20% Performance Allocation (subject to 
any Underperformance Carryforward) as described above. 
If the Index Return is greater than the Investor Return, in each case as calculated from the beginning 
to the end of the current Performance Allocation Calculation Period, the difference equals 
“Underperformance.” The amount of any Underperformance attributable to a Master Fund Account as of 
the end of a Performance Allocation Calculation Period will either (i) result in a Series A2 Restricted 
Performance Allocation Reduction (if applicable) or (ii) be carried forward (the “Underperformance 
Carryforward”) and applied to reduce future Performance Allocations. The amount of the 
Underperformance Carryforward is reduced (but not below $0) by subsequent Outperformance and 
increased by any subsequent Underperformance, except that, to the extent that any portion of a Series A2 
Restricted Performance Allocation is reduced pursuant to a Series A2 Restricted Performance Allocation 
Reduction, such su

The Performance Allocation is based on performance relative to the Index. Accordingly, if there is 
Outperformance as of the end of a Performance Allocation Calculation Period, a Performance Allocation 
is made to the Master Fund GP even if the Net Asset Value of a Master Fund Account has declined over 
the course of the Performance Allocation Calculation Period. Conversely, if there is Underperformance as 
of the end of a Performance Allocation Calculation, no Performance Allocation is made even if the Net 
Asset Value of a Master Fund Account has appreciated over the course of the Performance Allocation 
Calculation Period. 
For the avoidance of doubt, references herein to the Net Asset Value of a Master Fund Account 
will not include any amount of a Series A2 Restricted Performance Allocation. 
Redemptions During a Performance Allocation Calculation Period 
If Shares are redeemed from a Sub-Series of Series A2 Founders Shares, Series B3 Shares or Series 
C1 Shares as of a date other than a December 31, a Performance Allocation is calculated and made from 
the corresponding Master Fund Account to the Master Fund GP in an amount equal to: (i) the Performance 
Allocation that would have been made had the Redemption Date been a December 31, multiplied by (ii) 
the fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is the Gross Asset Value of the amount 
being redeemed from such Master Fund Account and the denominator of which is the Gross Asset Value 
of such Master Fund Account immediately prior to such Redemption (the “Reduction Percentage”). Upon 
such Redemption, the Base Amount, the Index Return, the Investor Return and the Underperformance 
Carryforward (if any) are reduced proportionately by an amount equal to the Base Amount, the Index 
Return, the Investor Return and the Underperformance Carryforward, respectively, being multiplied by the 
Reduction Percentage. 
For example, if 25% of a Sub-Series of Series A2 Founders Shares are redeemed, a Performance 
Allocation is made from the Master Fund Account corresponding to such Sub-Series equal to 25% of any 
accrued Performance Allocation attributable to such Master Fund Account as of the Redemption Date, and 
the Base Amount, the Index Return, the Investor Return and the Underperformance Carryforward are each 
reduced by 25% (i.e., the same proportionate reductions of the Master Fund Account’s Net Asset Value 
(and Base Amount), Index Return, Investor Return and Underperformance Carryforward are made). 
For the avoidance of doubt, the Performance Allocation made upon an intra-year Redemption is 
calculated and made solely with respect to the amount redeemed from a Master Fund Account, and the 
foregoing adjustments are intended to have no effect on the Performance Allocation calculated and made 
with respect to the remaining portion of such Master Fund Account as of the end of such Performance 
Allocation Calculation Period.

Management Fees and Performance Allocations are calculated and paid or made separately in 
respect of each Sub-Series. Shareholders holding Shares in more than one Sub-Series could be subject to 
Performance Allocations in respect of one or more of such Sub-Series, even though such Shareholder’s 
aggregate investment has, on an overall basis, been unprofitable. 
Two or more Sub-Series of Series A2 Founders Shares, Series B3 Shares or Series C1 Shares may 
be consolidated into a single Sub-Series as of the beginning of any Performance Allocation Calculation 
Period (as defined below) using the Net Asset Value per Share of the longest outstanding Sub-Series 
included in such consolidation; provided, that each Sub-Series was subject to a Performance Allocation as 
of the end of the immediately preceding Performance Allocation Calculation Period. Any such 
consolidation will have no economic effect on any Shareholder. 
The Fund may, but generally does not intend to, declare or pay Dividends. Dividend payments, 
if made, will be treated as Redemptions for Performance Allocation purposes.   
Transfers 
Transfers to new beneficial owners generally will be treated as a Redemption by the transferor 
(subject to a Performance Allocation, if due) and a new Subscription by the transferee.  Performance 
Allocations made as a result of a Transfer of part or all of a Shareholder’s Shares reduce the Net Asset 
Value of the Shares received by the Transferee. However, the Investment Manager may determine to treat 
the transferee as if it were the alter ego of the transferor for one or more purposes (including in respect of 
Performance Allocations), and generally intends to do so upon request if the transferee is a “Related 
Investor,” as determined by the Investment Manager in its sole discretion. 
Change in Law 
Each Shareholder agrees by subscribing to the Fund that, if due to a change in Law, the Master 
Fund GP or the Investment Manager Parties are required to repay Tax Distributions in respect of the Series 
A1 Restricted Performance Allocation or the Series A2 Restricted Performance Allocation, the Fund may 
amend the calculations and allocations of the Performance Allocation on a going forward basis, (A) such 
that (1) first, the Master Fund GP is allocated its actual tax liability associated with the calculation of the 
entire Performance Allocation as of the end of the Performance Allocation Period, (2) second, the Master 
Fund GP is allocated 50% of the remaining Performance Allocation amount as of the end of the 
Performance Allocation Period and (3) third, the Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation or the Series 
A2 Restricted Performance Allocation, as applicable, will initially be the remaining amount of the 
Performance Allocation amount or (B) to such other methodology that preserves the economic 
arrangements between the Shareholders and the Master Fund GP and achieves the intent expressed herein 
to the greatest extent possible while

Fund or a complete description even of those risks which are outlined — should be carefully evaluated 
before deciding whether to invest in the Fund. 
General Risks 
Limited Operating History 
As of the date of this Memorandum, the Fund and the Master Fund have only limited operating and 
performance history. There can be no assurance that the Fund will raise or maintain sufficient capital in 
order to fully implement its investment program and achieve its objectives. 
Potential Loss of Investment 
An investment in the Fund is speculative and involves substantial risks.  There can be no assurance 
that the Fund will achieve its objective or avoid incurring substantial or total losses.   
Alternative investment strategies which use leverage and/or take short positions — such as the 
strategy implemented by the Investment Manager for the Fund — are subject to a “risk of ruin” to which 
traditional, unleveraged, all-long strategies are not.  The use of leverage and short positions by alternative 
strategies not only increases the risk of loss, but also makes such strategies dependent on the willingness of 
brokers and dealers to continue to extend credit and lend securities to be sold short.   
Past Performance is not Indicative of Future Results 
The past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future results, and there can be 
no assurance that the Fund’s performance will be comparable in the future to how it has performed in the 
past.  In particular, due to the concentrated “buy and hold” nature of the Investment Manager’s strategies, 
certain individual positions acquired by the Fund may have a material and disproportionate contribution to 
the overall performance of the Fund during their holding periods (as compared to the Fund’s portfolio in 
general) that cannot or will not be replicated in the future.    
Prior to founding the Investment Manager, the Principal founded and operated Echinus Advisors, 
LLC, an investment adviser registered with the SEC that managed private funds (“Echinus Funds”) 
pursuant to investment strategies similar to those the Investment Manager will implement on behalf of the 
Fund. However, the past performance of the Echinus Funds is not necessarily indicative of the performance 
of the Fund, and there can be no assurance the performance of the Fund in the future will be comparable to 
the performance of the Echinus Funds in the past.  
Dependence on the Investment Manager and the Principal 
The Fund is dependent on the services of the Investment Manager, and the Investment Manager, in 
turn, is dependent on the services of the Principal, for directing the investing and trading activities of the 
Fund.  The success of the Fund is therefore heavily dependent on the activities, judgment and availability 
of the Principal.  If the services of the Principal became unavailable to the Investment Manager for any 
reason it could — at least in the foreseeable future — have a material adverse effect on

Not a Complete Investment Program 
The Fund’s portfolio is generally expected to be concentrated in a limited number of investments 
and not be broadly diversified.  The less diversified nature of the Fund’s strategy (as compared to more 
broadly diversified strategies and portfolios) can result in increased performance volatility and risk.  The 
Fund is not intended as, and does not constitute, a complete investment program. 
No Assurance of Non-Correlation to Traditional Portfolios 
One of the potential benefits of including “alternative” investment strategies in a traditional 
portfolio is the potential risk control gained from diversifying a portfolio into investment strategies that 
may not be highly correlated with the overall equity markets in general.  However, there can be no 
assurance, particularly during periods of market disruption and stress when the risk control benefits of 
diversification may be most important, that the Fund’s results will not be correlated to the general 
performance of the equity markets.  It is expected that the Fund’s investment portfolio will consist of a 
concentrated group of positions.  With such concentration and lack of diversification, losses incurred in 
such positions will have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s overall financial condition that might 
otherwise be mitigated if the Fund had a more diversified portfolio. This may be especially true during 
periods of market dislocation or volatility.  Since the Fund’s portfolio is expected to have a significant 
“long” bias that will generally seek to be fully invested and may engage in certain hedging activities on 
only a limited or occasional basis, a general drawdown in the overall equities markets will likely result in 
a significant decline in the value of the Fund’s assets or a complete loss.  Unless the Fund’s performance 
exhibits only limited correlation to the overall equity markets, an investment in the Fund will not provide 
meaningful diversification benefits to an overall portfolio. 
Competition; Potential Strategy Saturation 
The Fund competes with numerous other private investment funds, financial institutions and other 
investors pursuing similar strategies, many of which may have substantially greater resources than the Fund 
and the Investment Manager. 
The amount of capital committed to alternative investment strategies has increased dramatically 
during recent years.  The profit potential of the Fund may be materially reduced as a result of the 
“saturation” of the alternative investment field and competition for the same or similar types of trades and 
transactions. 
Risk of Loss Due to the Bankruptcy or Failure of Counterparties, Brokers or Exchanges 
The Fund is subject to the risk of the insolvency of its counterparties (such as broker-dealers, futures 
commission merchants, banks or other financial institutions, exchanges or clearinghouses). 
The Fund’s assets could be lost or impounded during a counterparty’s bank

Market Risks 
Market Risks in General 
The Investment Manager’s equity strategies are subject to multiple dimensions of market risk 
including, but not limited to: unexpected directional price movements; changes in the regulatory 
environment; changes in market volatility; political and market disruptions; misconduct by management; 
inaccurate government and financial reporting and unequal access to market information.   
The diversification of the Fund’s positions will be limited and may not provide meaningful risk 
control.  The particular or general types of market conditions in which the Fund may incur losses or 
experience unexpected performance volatility cannot be predicted, and the Fund may materially 
underperform other investment funds with substantially similar investment objectives and approaches. 
Declining Equity Markets 
The profit potential of the Fund may be materially diminished during market cycles in which there 
is a general decline in equity price levels. 
Volatility; Stagnant Markets 
The prices of the instruments traded by the Fund have been subject to periods of excessive volatility 
in the past, and such periods can be expected to recur.  Price movements are influenced by many 
unpredictable factors, such as market sentiment, inflation, interest-rate movements and general economic 
and political conditions. While volatility can create profit opportunities for the Fund, it can also create 
greater risk.   
Although volatility is one indication of market risk, certain of the investment strategies employed 
by the Fund rely for their profitability on market volatility contributing to the mispricings which they are 
designed to identify.  In periods of trendless or stagnant markets, certain of the strategies employed by the 
Fund may have materially diminished prospects for profitability. 
Inflation and Interest-Rate Risk 
Following an extended period during which interest rates have been at historic lows in a number of 
countries, the U.S. and many other countries have experienced rising inflation.  In response to rising 
inflation, central banks and governments have taken corrective actions, including increasing short-term and 
long-term interest rates or changing monetary policies or interest-rate policies. Governmental efforts to 
curb inflation often have negative effects on the level of economic activity. The operations of the issuers in 
which the Fund invests may be sensitive to interest-rate changes.  To the extent such issuers rely on 
financing for working capital needs, their profitability will be materially impacted by changes in interest 
rates.  Similarly, rising interest rates generally increases the costs of any leverage used by the Fund.  As 
such, inflation and rising interest rates can adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment and the 
performance of the Fund. There can be no assurance that inflation and interest rates will not continue to rise 
or have a material adverse effect on the Fun

of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Lack of liquidity can make it economically infeasible 
for the Fund to recognize profits on open positions or to close out open positions against which the market 
is moving, and the Fund may be required to hold such securities and instruments despite adverse price 
movements.  In addition, if the Fund makes a short sale of an illiquid or less liquid security or instrument, 
it may have difficulty in covering the short sale, resulting in a potentially unlimited loss on that position.   
United Kingdom Membership of the European Union 
  The United Kingdom (the “UK”) ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 
(“Brexit”).  During a prescribed period (the “Transitional Period”), which ended on December 31, 2020, 
certain transitional arrangements were in effect, such that the UK continued to be treated, in most respects, 
as if it were still a member of the EU, and generally remained subject to EU law.  On December 24, 2020, 
the EU and the UK reached an agreement in principle on the terms of certain agreements and declarations 
governing the ongoing relationship between the EU and the UK, including the EU-UK Trade and 
Cooperation Agreement (the “TCA”).  The TCA is limited in its scope primarily to the trade of goods, 
transport, energy links, and fishing; in particular, the TCA does not make any meaningful provision for the 
financial services sector.  Uncertainties remain relating to certain aspects of the UK’s future economic, 
trading, and legal relationships with the EU and with other countries.  

The impact of such events on the Fund is difficult to predict but they may adversely affect the return 
of the Fund and its investments. There may be detrimental implications for the value of certain of the Fund’s 
investments and/or the Fund’s ability to enter into transactions, to value or realize its investments or to 
otherwise implement its investment program.  It is possible that certain of the Fund’s investments may need 
to be restructured to enable the Fund’s objectives to be pursued fully.  This may increase costs or make it 
more difficult for the Fund to pursue its investment objectives. 
Extreme Market Disruptions 
The Investment Manager and the Fund are subject to risks associated with the consequences of 
natural disasters (e.g., fire, flood, earthquake, storm and hurricane), epidemics, pandemics and other 
outbreaks of serious contagious diseases (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian flu, 
H1N1/09 flu and COVID-19 (commonly known as the “Coronavirus”)), terrorist attacks (or the fear of or 
the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks), and other acts of war (e.g., war, invasion, acts of 
foreign enemies, hostilities and insurrection, regardless of whether war is declared). The occurrence of a 
natural disaster, epidemic, terrorist attacks or other acts of war (including the Russian invasion of Ukraine) 
have the potential to cause severe

Fund’s investments, even beyond any direct exposure the Fund may have to Russian issuers or the adjoining 
geographic regions.  The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market 
disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial.  Any such disruptions caused by Russian 
military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened 
responses to such activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer 
or purchaser preferences, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies 
or Russian individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia’s economy and Russian issuers of 
securities in which the Fund invests.  Actual and threatened responses to such military action may also 
impact the markets for certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of 
the Russian economy, and may likely have collateral impacts on such sectors globally. 
Strategy Risks 
Focus on Equity Securities; Directional Trading 
Although the Fund may trade a variety of financial instruments in implementing its investment 
strategy, the Investment Manager generally expects that the Fund will invest primarily in publicly-traded 
equity securities and the Fund’s strategies are based primarily on attempting to predict the future price level 
of different equity or equity-related instruments.  The price of equity securities are directly affected by 
issuer-specific events, as well as general market conditions. Numerous inter-related and difficult-to-
quantify economic factors, as well as market sentiment, subjective and extraneous political, climate-related 
and terrorist factors, influence the performance of equities. Price movements are often determined by 
unanticipated factors, and even if the determining factors are correctly identified, the Investment Manager’s 
analysis of those factors may prove inaccurate, potentially leading to substantial losses. Predicting future 
prices is inherently uncertain and the losses incurred, if the market moves against a position, will often not 
be hedged. Even if the Investment Manager’s analysis of a company’s fundamentals perform as expected, 
it is possible that its securities trade at a discount to the Investment Manager’s appraisal of intrinsic value 
for an extended period of time, or even indefinitely. As the Fund’s equity positions may be leveraged, even 
comparatively minor adverse market movements can result in substantial losses. Furthermore, 
mismanagement or misconduct by corporate officers can cause the complete loss of an equity investment. 
The speculative aspect of attempting to predict absolute price movements is generally perceived to exceed 
that involved in attempting to predict relative price fluctuations. 
Concentration of Investments 
The Fund’s investment portfolio can be expected to be highly concentrated in the securit

cause market prices to be materially discounted from the expected prices indicated by fundamental analysis 
or when technical factors, such as price momentum encouraged by trend following, dominate the market. 
It is impossible to predict the time it will take for market price and intrinsic value to converge (if 
ever). Even if the Investment Manager’s fundamental analysis of the intrinsic value of an investment may 
be accurate, the Fund may be unable to hold the position until such intrinsic value is reflected in market 
price. 
Reliance on Data 
The Investment Manager’s trading strategies are highly reliant on the gathering, cleaning, culling 
and analysis of large amounts of data from third-party and other external sources. It is not possible or 
practicable, however, to factor all relevant, available data into forecasts and/or trading decisions. The 
Investment Manager will use its discretion to determine what data to gather with respect to any strategy and 
what subset of that data the trading models take into account to produce forecasts which may have an impact 
on ultimate trading decisions. In addition, due to the automated nature of such data gathering and the fact 
that much of this data comes from third-party sources, it is inevitable that not all desired and/or relevant 
data will be available to, or processed by, the Investment Manager at all times. In such cases, the Investment 
Manager may and often will continue to generate forecasts and make trading decisions based on the data 
available to it. Additionally, the Investment Manager may determine that certain available data, while 
potentially useful in generating forecasts and/or making trade decisions, is not cost effective to gather due 
to either the technology costs or third-party vendor costs, and in such cases, the Investment Manager will 
not use such data. 
Investors should be aware that, for all of the foregoing reasons and more, there is no guarantee that 
any specific data or type of data will be utilized in generating forecasts or making trading decisions on 
behalf of the Fund, nor is there any guarantee that the data actually utilized in generating forecasts or making 
trading decisions on behalf of the Fund will be (i) the most accurate data available or (ii) free of errors. 
Investors should assume that the foregoing limitation and risks associated with gathering, cleaning, culling 
and analysis of large amounts of data from third-party and other external sources are an inherent part of 
investing with a process-driven, investment strategy such as the one employed by the Investment Manager 
on behalf of the Fund.  
Use of Alternative Data 
The analysis and interpretation of alternative data involves a high degree of uncertainty and may 
entail significant expense which may be borne by the Fund.  Alternative data typically refers to information 
derived from non-traditional sources of financial information.  Alternative data is often less structured than

companies in which the Fund invests. The Investment Manager, the Fund and the companies in which the 
Fund invests could be further exposed to the risks of Machine Learning Technology if third-party service 
providers or any counterparties, whether or not known to the Investment Manager, use Machine Learning 
Technology in their business activities. The Investment Manager will not be in a position to control the 
operations of third-party service providers or counterparties, the manner in which third-party products are 
developed or maintained or the manner in which third-party services are provided.  
Use of Machine Learning Technology could include the input of confidential information 
(including material non-public information) by third parties in contravention of non-disclosure agreements 
(or similar undertakings or obligations of confidentiality) into Machine Learning Technology applications, 
resulting in such confidential information becoming part of a dataset that is accessible by other third-party 
Machine Learning Technology applications and users. Machine Learning Technology and its applications, 
including in the private investment and financial sectors, continue to develop rapidly, and it is impossible 
to predict the future risks that may arise from such developments. 
Short Sales  
The Investment Manager will, from time to time, sell securities short in implementing the Fund’s 
investment strategies.  In order to initiate a “short” sale, a seller must “locate” a source from which the 
seller can borrow the securities to be sold short and in order to make delivery to the buyer of a security sold 
short, the seller must borrow the security.  In so doing, it incurs the obligation to replace that security, 
whatever its price may be, at the time it is required to deliver it to the lender.  The seller ordinarily fulfills 
its obligation to return a security previously sold short by acquiring fungible securities on the open market.   
When the Fund sells a security, the Fund must also pay to the lender of the security any dividends 
or interest payable on the security during the borrowing period and may have to pay a premium for the right 
to borrow the security.  This obligation must, unless the Fund then owns or has the right to obtain, without 
payment, securities identical to those sold short — which the Fund does generally not do — be 
collateralized by a deposit of cash or marketable securities with the lender.  Short selling is subject to a 
theoretically unlimited risk of loss because there is no limit on how much the price of a security may 
appreciate before the short position is closed out.  There can be no assurance that the securities necessary 
to cover the short position will be available for purchase by the Fund.  In addition, purchasing securities to 
close out the short position can itself cause the price of the relevant securities to rise further, thereby 
increasing any loss incurred by the Fund.  Furthermore,

Use of Leverage 
The Fund invests on a leveraged basis, primarily through its borrowings.  Losses incurred on the 
Fund’s leveraged investments increase in direct proportion to the degree of leverage employed.  The Fund 
also incurs interest expense on the borrowings used to leverage its positions. 
To the extent that the assets of the Fund have been leveraged through the borrowing of money, the 
purchase of securities on margin, or otherwise, the interest expense and other costs and premiums incurred 
in relation thereto may not be recovered.  The level of interest rates generally, and the rates at which the 
Fund can borrow in particular, are an expense of the Fund and therefore affect its profitability. If gains 
earned by the Fund’s portfolio fail to cover such costs, the Net Asset Value of the Fund may decrease faster 
than if the Fund had not engaged in such borrowing transactions.  
Financing Arrangements 
Leverage is integral to the Investment Manager’s strategy, and the Fund depends on the availability 
of credit in order to provide such leverage by financing its portfolio.  There can be no assurance that the 
Fund will be able to maintain adequate financing arrangements. 
As a general matter, the banks and dealers that provide financing to the Fund can apply essentially 
discretionary margin, haircut, financing, security and collateral valuation policies and, from time to time 
(for example, during the “market crises” of 1994, 1998 and 2008−2009), have largely eliminated the 
availability of financing in an attempt to protect their capital.  Reductions in available leverage would not 
only make it difficult for the Investment Manager to implement its strategies prospectively, but also would 
force the Fund to liquidate its existing positions, likely at material losses.   
Changes by banks and dealers in the foregoing policies, or the imposition of other credit limitations 
or restrictions, whether due to market circumstances or governmental, regulatory or judicial action, may 
result in margin calls, loss of financing, forced liquidation of positions at disadvantageous prices, 
termination of swap and repurchase agreements and cross-defaults to agreements with other dealers.  Any 
such adverse effects may be exacerbated in the event that such limitations or restrictions are imposed 
suddenly and/or by multiple market participants at or about the same time.  The imposition of such 
limitations or restrictions could compel the Fund to liquidate part or all of its portfolio at disadvantageous 
prices. 
Execution Risk 
The Fund will execute a number of trades in connection with its ongoing investment activities.  The 
cost of doing so will be materially affected by the efficiency of the Fund’s transactions.  Inefficient 
executions can generate substantial transaction costs over time, possibly materially reducing the 
profitability of the Fund’s positions.

its management, even though access to such information might have been advantageous to the Fund and 
other market participants are in possession of such information.  As a result of the foregoing limitations 
(including the inability to close out existing positions), the Fund may be subject to potential losses.   
Reliance on the Integrity of Financial and Economic Reporting 
The Fund’s equity-related strategies rely on the financial, economic and policy data made available 
by the issuer, government agencies, rating agencies, professional services firms and central banks.  Such 
data can have a material influence and effect on the investment positions taken by the Investment Manager 
on behalf of the Fund.  However, the Investment Manager generally has no ability to independently verify 
such information and will be dependent upon the integrity of the management of these issuers, as well as 
the competence of the individuals and processes by which such data is generated.  The Fund could incur 
material losses as a result of the misconduct or incompetence of such individuals and/or a failure of or 
substantial inaccuracy in the generation of such information.  Past events have demonstrated the material 
losses which investors such as the Fund can incur as a result of corporate mismanagement, fraud and 
accounting irregularities. 
Hedging 
The Investment Manager may attempt, but does not generally expect, to hedge certain market or 
other risks inherent in the Fund’s positions, and, in cases where it does hedge, may choose to do so only 
partially. Specifically, the Investment Manager may choose not to hedge certain risks or it may determine 
that it is economically unattractive to do so — either in respect of particular positions or in respect of the 
Fund’s overall portfolio. The Fund’s portfolio composition commonly results in various components of 
directional market risks remaining unhedged.   
Even if the Investment Manager is successful in establishing hedging positions, such hedging may 
reduce the Fund’s returns or possibly increase and/or cause material losses. Furthermore, it is possible that 
the Investment Manager’s hedging strategies will not be effective in controlling risk due to unexpected 
changes in correlation between the hedging instrument and the position being hedged, thereby increasing 
rather than reducing both risk and losses. 
To the extent that the Investment Manager engages in any hedging activities, its hedges are unlikely 
to be static but rather may need to be continually adjusted based on the Investment Manager’s assessment 
of market conditions, as well as the expected degree of non-correlation between the hedges and the portion 
of the portfolio being hedged. The success of the Investment Manager’s hedging strategy may depend on 
the Investment Manager’s ability to implement a dynamic hedging approach efficiently and cost effectively, 
as well as on the accuracy of the Investment Manager’s ongoing judgments

Limited Liquidity of Certain Portfolio Investments 
The Fund generally invests in securities or other instruments that are liquid (if not highly liquid) at 
the time of acquisition.  However, it is possible that certain positions acquired by the Fund may be thinly 
traded or relatively illiquid, and positions that were liquid at the time of acquisition may become illiquid 
while held by the Fund.  The Fund may also acquire securities in private offerings which may never be 
registered for resale or which may not be permitted to be resold for a period of time, as well as acquire 
substantial positions in a particular company relative to the total amount of such company’s outstanding 
securities.  In such cases, and in the event of extreme market activity, the Fund may be unable to close out 
a position against which the market is moving so as to limit losses or a position which has become profitable 
in order to realize the profits, or it may only be able to liquidate such a position at a substantial discount to 
fair market value.  The Fund’s sales of thinly traded securities could depress the market value of such 
securities and thereby reduce the Fund’s profitability or increase its losses. 
Co-Investments 
The Investment Manager may determine that certain investment opportunities appropriate for the 
Fund cannot or should not be acquired in full by the Fund based on such factors as the size or composition 
of the Fund’s overall portfolio, investment concentration or other reasons deemed relevant by the 
Investment Manager.  In such instances, the Investment Manager may (but is not required to) offer such 
excess investment opportunities to one or more investors in the Fund, to other funds or accounts managed 
by the Investment Manager, the Master Fund GP or their respective affiliates, or such other persons as 
determined by the Investment Manager.  The Investment Manager has no obligation to offer any such co-
investment opportunity to any Shareholder by virtue of its investment in the Fund, and may offer such 
opportunities to fewer than all Shareholders based on such factors as the Investment Manager may 
determine.  Investors participating in co-investment opportunities may do so by acquiring a separate class 
or series of Shares issued by the Fund that participates only in such co-investment opportunity (effectively, 
a “side pocket” investment within the Fund), or through vehicles managed by or otherwise affiliated with 
the Investment Manager (in each case, a “Co-Investment Vehicle”).  Alternatively, certain investors may 
invest directly in a particular co-investment opportunity alongside the Fund and/or a Co-Investment 
Vehicle.  The fees, other compensation, and terms of any investment in a Co-Investment Vehicle may differ 
from the fees, other compensation, or terms of an investment in either Partnership.  Those participating in 
such a co-investment opportunity, including those participating through a Co-Investment Vehicle, m

Certain Instruments Traded 
Equity Securities 
The Fund generally expects to invest primarily invest in equity securities on a long and short basis.  
The value of equity securities are directly affected by issuer-specific events, as well as general market 
conditions that can adversely affect the prices of equity securities within a particular industry, market sector 
or in general. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose 
performance diverges from the Investment Manager’s expectations or if equity markets generally move in 
an unfavorable direction with respect to the various equity security positions. The Fund also may be exposed 
to risks that issuers will not fulfill contractual obligations, such as, in the case of convertible securities or 
private placements, delivering marketable common stock upon conversions of convertible securities and 
registering restricted securities for public resale. 
Small Cap and Mid Cap Stocks in General 
The Fund may invest a portion of its capital (which may be material) in small cap and mid cap 
stocks.  The small cap and mid cap equity markets are, in general, subject to a number of materially greater 
risks than the larger capitalization equity market.  In particular, the securities of small cap and mid cap 
issuers are often more volatile and less liquid than investments in larger issuers, and more likely to be 
adversely affected by poor economic or market conditions.  Among the reasons for such increased risk are:  
the generally smaller amount of information that is available concerning small cap and mid cap issuers or 
stocks rather than large cap issuers or stocks; the tendency of all small cap and mid cap stocks to trade down 
during periods of market crisis; the greater chance for management misconduct or incompetence to 
materially adversely affect the prospects for the issuer as a whole; and the comparative illiquidity of the 
small cap and mid cap market, creating the possibility of unusually wide bid-ask spreads and increasing the 
expected delay before the market value is brought into equilibrium with actual or realizable value.    
Small and mid cap issuers can be particularly vulnerable to changes in economic conditions, 
including, for example, interest rates, inflation rates, industry conditions, competition, regulatory 
environment, technological developments, political and diplomatic events and trends, tax laws and 
innumerable other factors outside the control of the Investment Manager, that can substantially and 
adversely affect the business and prospects of the Fund. In addition, small cap and mid cap issuers may 
lack the management experience, financial resources and product diversification of larger companies, 
making them more susceptible to market pressures and business failure. 
Preferred Stock 
Preferred stock generally has a preference over an issuer’s common stock as to dividends and in 
the event of liquidation, but

-57- 
a particular period of time at a specified price or formula.  Convertible securities generally: (i) have higher 
yields than the dividends on the underlying common stocks, but lower yields than non-convertible securities 
of a comparable duration; (ii) are less volatile in price than the underlying common stock due to their fixed-
income characteristics; (iii) have a significant option component to their value which is directly impacted 
by the prevailing market volatility and interest rates; and (iv) provide the potential for capital appreciation 
if the market price of the underlying common stock increases.  The market for convertible securities is 
typically materially less liquid than that for the underlying common stock and the value of convertible 
securities more directly at risk to increases in interest rates. 
Fixed-Income Investments 
The Investment Manager could invest in fixed-income securities, such as debt securities issued by 
the U.S. government, or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any agency thereof, for defensive, liquidity 
or other purposes.  The pricing of fixed-income instruments is directly affected by interest-rate changes.  
When interest rates decline, the value of outstanding fixed-income instruments typically rises.  Conversely, 
when interest rates rise, the value of outstanding fixed-income instruments typically declines.   
Derivatives in General 
The use of derivative instruments involves a variety of material risks, including the extremely high 
degree of leverage often embedded in such instruments and the possibility of counterparty non-
performance, as well as material and prolonged deviations between the theoretical and realizable value of 
a derivative.  These anticipated risks (and other risks that may not be anticipated) may make it difficult, as 
well as costly, to the Fund to close out positions in order to realize gains or to limit losses. 
Certain derivatives that could be traded by the Fund may be principal-to-principal or “over-the-
counter” contracts between the Fund and third parties entered into privately, rather than on an exchange.  
As a result, the Fund will not be afforded the regulatory and financial protections of an exchange or its 
clearinghouse with respect to these transactions (or of the government regulator that oversees such 
exchange and clearinghouse).  In privately-negotiated transactions, the risk of the negotiated price deviating 
materially from fair value is substantial, particularly when there is no active market available from which 
to derive benchmark prices. 
Many derivatives are valued on the basis of dealers’ pricing of these instruments.  However, the 
price at which dealers value a particular derivative and the price that the same dealers would be willing to 
pay for such derivative should the Fund wish or be forced to sell such position may be materially different.  
Such differences can result in an overstatement of the Fund’s Net Asset Value and may materia

Forward Contracts 
The Fund may enter into forward contracts referenced to currencies and interest rates, through U.S. 
and non-U.S. national or local banks and currency and rates dealers.  Forward contracts and options thereon, 
unlike futures contracts, are not traded on exchanges and are not standardized; rather, banks and dealers act 
as principals in these markets, negotiating each transaction on an individual basis.  Forward and “cash” 
trading is currently substantially unregulated; there is no limitation on daily price movements and 
speculative position limits are not applicable.  The principals who deal in the forward markets are not 
required to continue to make markets in the currencies or commodities they trade and these markets can 
experience periods of illiquidity, sometimes of significant duration.  There have been periods during which 
certain participants in these markets have been unable to quote prices for certain currencies or commodities 
or have quoted prices with an unusually wide spread between the price at which they were prepared to buy 
and that at which they were prepared to sell.  Disruptions can occur in any market traded by the Fund due 
to unusually high trading volume, political intervention, or other factors. 
The imposition of credit controls by governmental authorities may limit such forward trading to 
less than that which the Investment Manager would otherwise recommend, to the possible detriment of the 
Fund.  The Fund is subject to the risk of the failure of, or the inability or refusal to perform with respect to 
its forward contracts by, the principals with which the Fund trades.  Only certain forward trades are 
regulated by the CFTC.  Assets on deposit with such principals are also generally not protected by the same 
segregation requirements imposed on CFTC-regulated commodity brokers in respect of customer funds on 
deposit with them.  Accordingly, the insolvency or bankruptcy of such parties could also subject the Fund 
to the risk of loss.  The full scope of the recent changes in CFTC regulation to forward markets is not yet 
known. 
Equity-Linked Instruments and Related Options 
Certain financial instruments traded by the Fund may be referenced to underlying equities but also 
incorporate other components — duration, strike price, premiums, etc. — which can result in the Fund’s 
positions being unprofitable even though the Investment Manager may have correctly assessed the market 
value of the underlying equity instrument. 
The Investment Manager may trade in put and call options, which involve qualitatively different 
risks than owning the underlying common stock. 
Options may be traded on and off exchanges.  An option is a right, purchased for a certain price, to 
either buy or sell an underlying futures contract, security or other financial instrument.  Such trading 
involves risks substantially similar to those involved in trading futures and forward contracts in that options 
are specu

like shares of common stock, and the value of ETF securities fluctuate in relation to changes in the value 
of the underlying portfolio of securities.  However, the market price of ETF securities may not be equivalent 
to the pro rata value of the underlying portfolio of securities.  ETF securities are subject to the risks of an 
investment in a broad-based portfolio of common stocks or to the risks of a concentrated, industry-specific 
investment in common stocks. 
Non-U.S. Investments 
The Fund may invest globally, including in the securities of non-U.S. issuers listed on non-U.S. 
exchanges, which may include investments in lesser developed and emerging markets.  Investing in non-
U.S. issuers and markets can involve (to a greater or lesser degree depending on the geography) certain 
risks and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the most developed economies or 
securities markets.  Such risks may include:  (i) the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets or 
confiscatory taxation; (ii) social, economic and political uncertainty including war; (iii) dependence on 
exports and the corresponding importance of international trade; (iv) price fluctuations, less liquidity and 
the smaller capitalization of the securities markets; (v) currency exchange-rate fluctuations; (vi) rates of 
inflation (including hyperinflation); (vii) controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of 
invested capital and on the Fund’s ability to exchange local currencies for U.S. dollars; (viii) governmental 
involvement in and control over the economies; (ix) governmental decisions to discontinue support of 
economic reform programs generally and to impose centrally planned economies; (x) differences in auditing 
and financial reporting standards which may result in the unavailability of material information about 
issuers, and the information that is available may be unreliable; (xi) less extensive regulation of the 
securities markets; (xii) longer settlement periods for securities transactions in emerging markets; (xiii) less 
developed corporate laws regarding fiduciary duties of officers and directors and the protection of investors; 
and (xiv) certain considerations regarding the maintenance of Fund portfolio securities and cash with non-
U.S. sub-custodians and securities depositories.  The foregoing risks tend to be exacerbated in lesser 
developed and emerging markets. 
Cash and Related Investments 
The Fund may invest all or a portion of its capital in cash or cash items pending it making other 
investments.  These cash items will typically be deemed by the Investment Manager to be high quality at 
the time of investment and may include a number of money market instruments such as negotiable

Structural Risks 
Material Restrictions on Redemptions 
There are material restrictions on a Shareholder’s ability to redeem Shares from the Fund, and 
transfers are permitted only with the consent of, and on terms acceptable to, the Investment Manager.  In 
general, capital can only be redeemed monthly upon at least (x) sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, with 
respect to Founders Shares, and (y) ninety (90) days’ prior written notice, with respect to B Shares or C 
Shares. 
The Monthly Redemption Allowance limits the maximum amount of a Shareholder’s Shares that 
can be redeemed as of any monthly Redemption Date (measured as of the first Redemption Date, as adjusted 
for subsequent gains and losses) to (x) 1/12 (or 8.33%) of such Shareholder’s Shares, with respect to 
Founders Shares, (y) 1/24 (or 4.17%) of such Shareholder’s Shares, with respect to B Shares, or (z) 1/18 
(or 5.56%) of such Shareholder’s Shares, with respect to C Shares, following the conclusion of the C Shares 
Lock-Up Period.  Accordingly, a complete Redemption of a Shareholder’s Shares can only be made over 
the course of twelve (12), twenty-four (24) or eighteen (18) monthly Redemption Dates, as applicable.  
Although a complete redemption is not required to be made over the course of twelve, twenty-four or 
eighteen consecutive Redemption Dates, as applicable, a Shareholder’s Monthly Redemption Allowance 
will remain at or be “reset” to 1/12, 1/24 or 1/18 of the remainder of such Shareholder’s Shares if a 
Shareholder: (i) redeems less than the maximum Monthly Redemption Allowance in effect for a particular 
Redemption Date; (ii) does not redeem Shares for three consecutive Redemption Dates; or (iii) makes a 
new Subscription to the Fund.  
The Fund’s Redemption terms have been designed to complement the Fund’s investment strategy 
which generally expects to take large positions with a longer-term view in an attempt to derive value over 
time.  However, such Redemption restrictions are materially more restrictive than those of many other 
alternative investment funds implementing strategies generally similar to those of the Investment Manager. 
B Shares are subject to a longer redemption cycle and a longer redemption notice period than 
Founders Shares.  C Shares, unlike other Shares issued by the Fund, are subject to the C Shares Lock-Up 
Period, and thus a longer redemption cycle than Founders Shares and B Shares, as well as a longer 
redemption notice period than Founders Shares.  Further, Shareholders holding Founders Shares are 
permitted to subscribe for additional Founders Shares under the Founders Capacity Rights.  These 
Shareholders (and the Investment Manager Parties holding investments with equivalent redemption terms 
to the Founders Shares) may redeem their Shares and reduce their exposure to the Fund (and therefore the 
Master Fund’s trading) more rapidly than Shareholders holding B Shares and Shareholders holding C 
Shares, having a material negati

investors and may make decisions that are not in the best interest of such other investors.  In addition, if 
one or more of such major investors redeem from the Fund or the Master Fund for any reason (which may 
be entirely unrelated to the performance of the Fund and the Master Fund), it could have a material adverse 
effect on the Fund.  Such redemptions could require the Master Fund to liquidate securities positions more 
rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, possibly reducing the value of the Master Fund’s (and therefore 
the Fund’s) assets and/or disrupting the Investment Manager’s investment and trading strategies.  Reduction 
in the size of the Fund and the Master Fund could make it more difficult to generate positive returns or to 
recoup losses due to, among other things, reductions in the Master Fund’s ability to take advantage of 
particular investment opportunities or decreases in the ratio of its income to its expenses.   
No Control Over Portfolio Companies  
The Fund may from time to time acquire substantial positions in the securities of particular 
companies.  However, the Fund will rarely, if ever, have any influence on the management of the companies 
in which it invests.  As a passive investor, the Fund will be dependent on the quality of the incumbent 
management.  In the case of many of the portfolio companies in which the Fund invests, the Investment 
Manager would not itself have the expertise or the resources to manage the companies.  There have been a 
number of well-publicized instances in which management has materially, if not fraudulently, mismanaged 
companies which otherwise appeared to have superior business models. 
Contagion Risk 
The Fund (as well as the Master Fund) has the authority to issue multiple classes, series and tranches 
of shares or interests.  However, the Fund is a single legal entity and there is no limited recourse protection 
for any class, series or tranche. Accordingly, all of the assets of the Fund will be available to meet all of its 
liabilities regardless of the class, series or tranche to which such assets or liabilities are attributable. In 
practice, cross-class, cross-series or cross-tranche liability is only expected to arise where liabilities 
referable to one class, series or tranche are in excess of the assets referable to such class, series or tranche 
and it is unable to meet all liabilities attributed to it.  In such a case, the assets of the Fund attributable to 
other classes, tranches or series may be applied to cover such liability excess and the value of the 
contributing classes, tranches or series will be reduced as a result.   
All classes, series and tranches of Shares issued by the Fund are expected to participate in the same 
portfolio, except in respect of any currency hedging by the Master Fund on behalf of the Fund or a particular 
class, series or tranche of Shares.  Any profits, losses and expenses associated with any such currency 
hedging by the Ma

Broad Indemnification of the Master Fund GP and the Investment Manager 
The Master Fund’s limited partnership agreement and the Investment Management Agreement 
contains provisions that may provide broader indemnification of the Master Fund GP, the Investment 
Manager, their members, partners, employees, agents or other affiliates against claims or lawsuits arising 
out of the Fund’s activities than would apply in the absence of such provisions.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, no exculpation or indemnification provisions waive any rights or claims a Shareholder may have 
under U.S. federal or state securities laws. 
Cybersecurity Risk 
The Investment Manager, the Fund and their service providers, counterparties and electronic 
communication networks are subject to risks associated with a breach in cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity is a 
generic term used to describe the technology, processes and practices designed to protect networks, systems, 
computers, programs and data from cyber-attacks and hacking by other computer users, and to avoid the 
resulting damage and disruption of hardware and software systems, loss or corruption of data, and/or 
misappropriation of confidential information.  Hardware and software systems are subject to threats from 
hackers and others, such as a malicious attack, malware or other event that leads to unanticipated 
interruption or malfunction of such systems.  Any interruption of the Investment Manager’s hardware or 
software functionality could lead to material or even complete losses to the Fund.  Hackers could also 
theoretically access and steal the Investment Manager’s research or trading programs or other software or 
data and implement such programs or software on their own behalf.  This could lead to increased 
competition for, or elimination of, the investment opportunities sought by the Fund or otherwise render the 
research or trading program obsolete, possibly resulting in material or complete losses to the Fund.  The 
Fund may also incur substantial costs as the result of a cybersecurity breach, including those associated 
with forensic analysis of the origin and scope of the breach, increased and upgraded cybersecurity, identity 
theft, unauthorized use of proprietary information, litigation, adverse investor reaction, the dissemination 
of confidential and proprietary information and reputational damage.  Any such breach could expose the 
Investment Manager and the Fund to civil liability as well as regulatory inquiry and/or action.  In addition, 
Shareholders could be exposed to additional losses as a result of unauthorized use of their personal 
information.  There are inherent limitations in business continuity plans and systems designed to prevent 
cyber-attacks, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified.

adversely affect the Fund by, among other reasons, prompting Redemptions, limiting access to investment 
opportunities, re-directing Investment Manager resources and generally disrupting the normal operational 
activities of the Investment Manager and the Fund. 
Limited Regulatory Oversight of the Fund 
The Fund is not registered and does not intend to register as an investment company under the 
Company Act or any comparable regulatory regimes, nor is the Fund subject to regulation comparable to 
the rules for Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”).  Accordingly, 
the provisions of such regulations, which among other things generally require investment companies to 
have a majority of disinterested directors, require securities held in custody to be maintained at all times in 
segregated accounts and regulate the relationship between the investment company and its asset manager, 
are not applicable to an investment in the Fund.  The Fund also is not subject to regulation comparable to 
the Company Act in any non-U.S. jurisdiction.  Therefore, the Shareholders do not have the benefit of the 
protections afforded, nor is the Fund subject to the restrictions imposed, by such registration and regulation. 
The Investment Manager is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers 
Act. The Investment Manager and the Master Fund GP are currently exempt from registration as a 
“commodity pool operator” with the CFTC pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3), and therefore are not subject 
to increased regulation by the CFTC or the NFA.  However, registration as an investment adviser or as a 
commodity pool operator (if such designation is obtained in the future) does not in any respect indicate any 
level of qualification or expertise — much less any approval — of the Investment Manager or the Fund by 
the SEC or the CFTC.  Such regulation of the Investment Manager will result in limited regulation of the 
Fund itself. 
The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
In response to the financial crises of 2008-2009, Dodd-Frank was enacted in July 2010.  Dodd-
Frank established a comprehensive framework for the regulation of markets, market participants and 
financial instruments that were previously unregulated and substantially altered the regulation of many 
other markets, market participants and financial instruments.  Dodd-Frank could result in certain investment 
strategies in which the Fund engages or may have otherwise engaged becoming non-viable or non-
economic to implement.  Dodd-Frank and regulations adopted pursuant to Dodd-Frank could have a 
material adverse impact on the profit potential of the Fund.  See also “—Regulation of the Over-the-Counter 
Derivatives Market,” below. 
The “Volcker Rule” component of the Dodd-Frank materially restricts proprietary speculative 
trading by banks, “bank holding companies” and certain other regulated entities.  As a result, there has

derivatives dealers.  These requirements may increase the amount and quality of collateral the Fund is 
required to provide and the costs associated with providing it.  OTC derivative dealers also are required to 
post margin to the clearinghouses through which they clear their customers’ cleared trades instead of using 
such margin in their operations, as was widely permitted before Dodd-Frank.  This has increased and will 
continue to increase the OTC derivative dealers’ costs, and these increased costs are generally passed 
through to other market participants in the form of higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less 
favorable trade pricing, and the imposition of new or increased fees, including account maintenance fees. 
With respect to cleared OTC derivatives, the Fund does not face a clearinghouse directly but does 
so through an OTC derivatives dealer that is registered with the CFTC or SEC to act as a clearing member.  
The Fund may face the indirect risk of another clearing member customer failing to meet its obligations to 
its clearing member, thereby causing the clearing member to default in its obligations to the Fund.  Although 
in the U.S. cleared OTC derivatives are not generally subject to the same “fellow customer risk” as cleared 
futures contracts due to the operation of the CFTC’s “legally segregated, but operationally commingled” 
customer protection rules, if a clearinghouse through which the Fund clears OTC derivatives fails for any 
reason, including due to a default by a cleared swaps customer of any futures commission merchant 
(“FCM”), the Fund will suffer losses to the extent that such failure causes the Fund’s FCM to default or 
the Fund’s FCM is no longer obligated to perform on the cleared OTC derivative following the failure of 
the clearinghouse.   
The CFTC also requires certain derivative transactions that were previously executed on a bi-lateral 
basis in the OTC markets to be executed through a regulated futures exchange or swap execution facility.  
The SEC may impose similar requirements on certain security-based derivatives in the future, though it is 
not yet clear when these parallel SEC requirements will go into effect.  Such requirements may make it 
more difficult and costly for investment funds, including the Fund, to enter into highly tailored or 
customized transactions.  They may also render certain strategies in which the Fund might otherwise engage 
impossible or uneconomic to implement.  If the Fund decides to become a direct member of one or more 
of these exchanges or execution facilities, the Fund would be subject to all of the rules of the exchange or 
execution facility, which would bring additional risks, liabilities, and regulatory requirements. 
OTC derivative dealers are now required to register with the CFTC and the SEC.  Registered swap 
and security-based swap dealers are also subject to margin requirements and minimum capital requirements, 
and are subject to business co

distortions is compounded by the fact that in disrupted markets many positions become illiquid, making it 
difficult or impossible to close out positions against which the markets are moving.  The financing available 
to the Fund from its banks, dealers and other counterparties is typically reduced in disrupted markets.  Such 
a reduction may result in substantial losses to the Fund.  Market disruptions may from time to time cause 
dramatic losses for the Fund, and such events can result in otherwise historically low-risk strategies 
performing with unprecedented volatility and risk. 
Political Uncertainty 
Some of the results of elections and referenda in recent years in the United States, Europe, Italy, 
China, India and other developed and emerging market countries have been unexpected and resulted in 
material market changes and increases in market uncertainty.  Given recent changes in administrations and 
applicable law following these votes, there is likely to be substantial uncertainty regarding the state and 
effect of financial and other regulation for the foreseeable future.  These uncertainties, as well as the impact 
of any new regulations, or the modification or elimination of existing regulations, could have a material 
adverse effect on the Fund. 
In particular, increased tensions between Russia and Ukraine have resulted in a Russian invasion 
of Ukraine. Escalating tensions involving these two countries may result in more widespread conflict. Such 
hostilities could have a severe adverse effect on the region, including significant negative impacts on the 
economy and the markets for certain securities and commodities, such as oil and natural gas.  How long 
such tensions and related events will last cannot be predicted.  These tensions and any related events could 
have significant impact on Fund performance and the value of an investment in the Fund. 
EU Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers 
The EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (Directive 2011/61/EU (the “AIFMD”)), 
where implemented in a member state of the European Economic Area (“EEA Member State”), applies 
to alternative investment fund managers (“AIFMs”) which manage and/or market alternative investment 
funds (“AIFs”) in the European Economic Area (“EEA”).  
For an AIFM established in a jurisdiction other than an EEA Member State which implemented the 
AIFMD (a “non-EEA AIFM”) marketing an AIF, the AIFMD requires that, at a minimum, the non-EEA 
AIFM must provide certain disclosures to EEA investors in the AIF, as well as provide reports on a regular 
basis to the regulator in each EEA Member State where the AIF is marketed. In addition, the AIFMD 
includes a requirement that there must be cooperation arrangements in place between the regulators in each 
of: (i) the jurisdiction where the non-EEA AIFM is established; (ii) each EEA Member State into which the 
AIF is being marketed; and (iii) the jurisdiction where the AIF is established

MiFID II 
The EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2014/65/EU) and Markets in 
Financial Instruments Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 600/2014) (together, “MiFID II”) govern the 
provision of investment services and activities in relation to, as well as the organized trading of, financial 
instruments such as shares, bonds, units in collective investment schemes and derivatives.  MiFID II was 
required to be implemented in EU member states from January 3, 2018.  Although the Fund is not organized 
in the EU, and is not authorized or regulated by any EU member state financial services regulator, certain 
aspects of MiFID II may have an impact on the Fund.   
MiFID II imposes certain restrictions as to the trading of shares and derivatives, which could apply 
to transactions made by or with the Fund.  Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Fund may be 
unable to trade shares or derivatives with or through affected EU-regulated firms (e.g., EU broker-dealers) 
other than as provided by MiFID II. MiFID II also applies position limits to the size of a net position that a 
person can hold at all times in commodity derivatives traded on EU trading venues and in “economically 
equivalent” OTC derivatives. 
More generally, EU regulated firms that have trading relationships with the Fund may be obliged 
by MiFID II to impose certain requirements on the Fund, or they may seek to do so contractually, with a 
view to satisfying their own compliance obligations.  It is difficult to predict the full impact of MiFID II on 
the Fund.  Prospective investors should also be aware that there may be costs (whether direct or indirect) 
of compliance with MiFID II. 
The UK has equivalent rules to those in MiFID II.  Accordingly, although the Fund is not organized 
in the UK, and is not authorized or regulated by the UK FCA, similar consequences to those discussed 
above would arise when trading with or through UK regulated firms and/or holding positions in commodity 
derivatives traded on UK trading venues and in economically equivalent OTC derivatives.  
European Market Infrastructure Regulation 
The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 648/2012) (“EMIR”) entered 
into force on August 16, 2012.  EMIR introduced certain requirements in respect of derivative contracts, 
which apply primarily to “financial counterparties” (“FCs”) such as EU-authorized investment firms, credit 
institutions, insurance companies, UCITS and AIFs as well as non-EU AIFs which are managed by AIFMs 
authorized under AIFMD.  EMIR also applies to “non-financial counterparties” (“NFCs”) which are 
entities established in the EU which are not FCs.  NFCs whose transactions in OTC derivative contracts 
exceed EMIR’s prescribed clearing thresholds (“NFC+s”) are generally subject to more stringent 
requirements under EMIR than NFCs whose transactions in OTC derivative contracts do not exceed such 
clearing thresholds (including because such con

-67- 
As the Fund is established outside the EU and is not managed by an AIFM authorized under 
AIFMD, the Fund is not directly subject to the requirements of EMIR; however, where the Fund transacts 
with in-scope EU counterparties, such counterparties may be required to apply certain provisions of EMIR 
so that the EU counterparty can fulfil its regulatory obligations and ensure that the transaction is EMIR-
compliant.  Where certain thresholds are exceeded, the cost of complying with EMIR, especially the cost 
of collateral required to meet variation and initial margin requirements associated with OTC transactions 
and clearing and the risk mitigation measures, may materially impact the Fund’s returns and its ability to 
trade with certain counterparties. 
The EU regulatory framework and legal regime relating to derivatives is set out not only by EMIR 
but also by MiFID II.  In particular, MiFID II requires transactions between FC+s and NFC+s in certain 
sufficiently liquid OTC derivatives to be executed on a trading venue which meets the requirements of the 
MiFID II regime (the “Derivatives Trading Obligation” or “DTO”). This trading obligation will also 
extend to FC+s and NFC+s which trade with third country counterparties that would be classed as FC+s or 
NFC+s if they were established in the EU. 
Prospective investors should be aware that the costs of complying with the requirements of EMIR 
and MiFID II could significantly raise the costs of entering into derivative contracts and that EMIR may 
adversely affect the Fund’s ability to engage in certain transactions in derivatives. 
The UK has equivalent rules to those in EMIR (“UK EMIR”), since EMIR has been retained as 
UK law by the EUWA, and also UK rules equivalent to that of the DTO under MiFID II (“UK DTO”).  As 
the Fund is established outside the UK and is not managed by a UK AIFM (as defined in the FCA 
Handbook), the Fund is not directly subject to the requirements of UK EMIR or the UK DTO; however, 
where the Fund transacts with in-scope UK counterparties, such counterparties may be required to apply 
certain provisions of UK EMIR so that the UK counterparty can fulfil its regulatory obligations under UK 
EMIR and the UK DTO.  As a result, the Fund may be subject to additional contractual obligations and/or 
costs that may not otherwise have applied.  
EU Short Selling Regulation 
Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 on Short Selling and Certain Aspects of Credit Default Swaps (as 
supplemented by Commission Delegated Regulations 918/2012, 919/2012, 826/2012 and Commission 
Implementing Regulation 827/2012) (the “SSR”) applies directly (i.e., without national implementation) in 
all Member States of the EU. The SSR imposes certain private and public disclosure obligations on all 
natural or legal persons, irrespective of regulatory status, located inside or outside the EU, who have net 
short positions (as calculated in accordance with the SSR) in EU listed shares and EU sovereign debt,

hedge certain risks through EU sovereign CDS. Accordingly, the ability of the Investment Manager to 
implement the investment approach and to fulfil the investment objective of the Fund may be constrained. 
For the purposes of this provision, “EU listed shares” means shares admitted to trading on a 
regulated market or multilateral-trading facility (as defined in MiFID) in the EU, unless the principal trading 
venue (as determined by the relevant national regulator) for the relevant shares is located in a country 
outside the EU; “EU sovereign debt” means debt instruments issued by an EU sovereign issuer (which 
includes EU institutions, governments of EU Member States and certain international institutions 
established by two or more EU Member States); and “MiFID” means Directive 2014/65/EU on Markets in 
Financial Instruments.  
The UK has equivalent rules that apply to UK listed shares, UK sovereign debt and UK sovereign 
CDS, mutatis mutandis (“UK SSR”), since the SSR has been retained as UK law by the European Union 
(Withdrawal) Act 2018. Accordingly, the UK SSR may prevent the Investment Manager from fully 
expressing negative views in relation to UK listed shares and/or UK sovereign debt and may also restrict 
the ability of the Investment Manager to hedge certain risks through UK sovereign CDS. 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 
Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 740, “Income Taxes” (in part formerly known as 
“FIN 48”) (“ASC 740”), provides guidance on the recognition of uncertain tax positions.  ASC 740 
prescribes the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized 
in an entity’s financial statements.  It also provides guidance on recognition, measurement, classification 
and interest and penalties with respect to tax positions.  Prospective investors should be aware that, among 
other things, ASC 740 could have a material adverse effect on the periodic calculations of the Net Asset 
Value of the Master Fund or the Net Asset Value of the Fund, including reducing the Net Asset Value of 
the Master Fund or the Net Asset Value of the Fund to reflect reserves for income or other taxes.  This 
could cause benefits or detriments to certain investors, depending upon the timing of their entry and exit 
from the Fund. 
Tax Audits 
The Master Fund or the Fund may be audited by U.S. federal, state or other tax authorities. An 
income tax audit may result in an increased tax liability of the Master Fund or the Fund, including with 
respect to years when an investor was not a Shareholder of the Fund, which could reduce the Net Asset 
Value of the Fund or the Master Fund and affect the return of all Shareholders. 
Possibility of a Qualified Audit Report 
Although the Investment Manager considers it to be unlikely, it is possible that the Fund may 
receive a qualified audit report from the Fund’s independent certified public accountants.

Legal and Statutory Rights 
There can be no assurance that income tax, securities, and other law or the interpretation and 
application of such law by courts or governmental authorities will not be changed in a manner which 
adversely affects the Master Fund, the Fund or the Shareholders. 
Tax Generally 
Prospective investors are strongly urged to consult their own tax advisors and counsel with respect 
to the possible tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund. 
THE SHARES ARE SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.  THEY 
ARE SUITABLE ONLY FOR PERSONS WHO CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR ENTIRE 
INVESTMENT.  THE FOREGOING LIST OF RISK FACTORS DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A 
COMPLETE EXPLANATION OF THE RISKS INVOLVED IN THIS OFFERING. 
CERTAIN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
The following potential, as well as actual, conflicts of interest may materially and adversely affect 
the Fund.  Shareholders have no means of determining whether these conflicts are being equitably resolved.  
Shareholders are not represented separately by counsel. 
The Investment Manager 
General 
The Investment Manager may manage one or more Other Accounts, and there is no limit on the 
number of such Other Accounts that may be managed and/or advised by the Investment Manager.  The 
Investment Manager may have financial incentives to favor certain Other Accounts over the Fund.  Even if 
the Investment Manager does not have such incentives, the Investment Manager will be required to allocate 
its resources among the Fund and the Other Accounts that the Investment Manager manages and/or advises. 
Certain Other Accounts may pursue similar or overlapping strategies to those implemented by the 
Fund.  The Investment Manager seeks to allocate investment opportunities and treat all similarly situated 
funds and accounts fairly and equitably over time to the extent such opportunities are determined to be 
appropriate for the Fund and Other Accounts, subject to the materially different regulatory requirements 
and other distinguishing factors applicable to different Other Accounts.  Nonetheless, the Investment 
Manager may have a material conflict of interest between allocating investment opportunities in a manner 
that treats all Other Accounts fairly over time and allocating investment opportunities in a manner that 
maximizes performance-based compensation, as well as in accommodating varying withdrawal or 
redemption terms.  Although the Investment Manager has an investment allocation policy designed to treat 
all such Other Accounts fairly over time, the performance of the Fund and Other Accounts may differ 
substantially even though their investment objectives and strategies may be substantially the same or 
similar.  Other Accounts may substantially outperform the Fund. 
The Investment Manager may trade on behalf of Other Accounts in a manner that differs from or 
conflicts with trades made on behalf of the Fund, even though they implement similar or overlapping

The Investment Manager may engage in a wide variety of business transactions with parties that 
provide services to the Fund as well as parties that trade in the same markets as the Fund.   
By reason of the other business activities of one or more of the Investment Manager Parties, the 
Investment Manager may not be able, or may determine not, to initiate a transaction for the Fund that the 
Investment Manager would otherwise have initiated for the Fund.  For example, an Investment Manager 
Party may from time to time inadvertently receive “material non-public information” relating to an issuer, 
in which case the Investment Manager would be prevented from transacting in the stock (or other securities) 
of such issuer (including closing out existing positions in such issuer) until such information was made 
public or ceased to be material, which may result in losses. 
Performance Allocations 
The Investment Manager believes the prospect of receiving a Performance Allocation provides a 
strong incentive to manage the Fund profitably.  However, the Performance Allocation received by the 
Master Fund GP, an affiliate of the Investment Manager, creates a conflict between the Investment 
Manager’s interest in earning a profit in the short term and the long-term interests of the Fund.  Specifically, 
the Investment Manager may have an incentive to invest Fund assets in investments that are riskier or more 
speculative than would be the case if the Master Fund GP was only compensated based on a flat percentage 
of capital, because these investments may allow the Master Fund GP to collect larger performance-based 
compensation. 
Subject to the Series A1 Restricted Performance Allocation Reduction and the Series A2 Restricted 
Performance Allocation Reduction, as applicable, while the Performance Allocation entitles the Master 
Fund GP to a priority allocation of any gains or outperformance (as the case may be) attributable to a 
Shareholder’s Sub-Series, the Master Fund GP is not subject to any comparable priority allocation of the 
losses or underperformance (as the case may be) attributable to such Shareholder’s Sub-Series (even if only 
to the extent of offsetting prior Performance Allocations).  Performance Allocations once made are not 
subject to being rebated or returned as a result of subsequent losses.  
Allocation of Expenses 
Expenses related to the internal operations and overhead of the Investment Manager and its 
affiliates incurred while fulfilling their respective roles and responsibilities will not be allocated to the 
Linonia Partners Funds, except as otherwise specifically provided hereunder.  However, the Investment 
Manager may have a conflict of interest in determining whether an expense constitutes an operating expense 
of the Fund or the Investment Manager’s general overhead.  In addition, the Investment Manager may 
manage Other Accounts in the future and may, to the extent permissible and reasonably practicable, allocate

and others, and are entitled to rely on information provided by third parties as well as the Investment 
Manager in calculating Net Asset Value. 
Side Letters; Different Business Terms 
Through the use of side letters, the Fund may from time to time permit certain Shareholders to 
acquire Shares on different business terms than other Shareholders; provided, that: (i) the Investment 
Manager does not expect doing so will have a material adverse effect on the other Shareholders; (ii) no 
Shareholder will be offered different Redemption terms than any other Shareholder if the Investment 
Manager believes such terms constitute “preferential liquidity” within the meaning of applicable SEC 
interpretation or that are not disclosed to such Shareholder and (iii) such arrangements do not violate 
applicable law or regulations.  The Fund and the Master Fund have each entered into side letters with their 
investors.    
Aggregation of Orders 

To the extent the Investment Manager advises Other Accounts, it may make investment decisions 
for the Master Fund together with or independently from such Other Accounts.  Investments of the kind 
made by the Master Fund may often also be made by such Other Accounts.  The Investment Manager may 
combine orders on behalf of the Master Fund with orders for Other Accounts for which the Investment 
Manager has trading authority or in which the Investment Manager has an economic interest.  In such cases, 
the Investment Manager will use best efforts to allocate the securities or proceeds arising out of those 
transactions (and the related transaction expenses) among the various participants on an overall basis (exact 
equality of treatment may not be possible in each instance).  While the Investment Manager believes 
combining orders in this way will, over time, be advantageous to all participants, in particular cases the 
price could be less advantageous to the Master Fund than if the Master Fund had been the only account 
effecting the transaction or had completed its transaction before the other participants. 
Cross Trades  

To the extent that the Investment Manager advises other client accounts in addition to the Fund, 
the Investment Manager may, in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements (including 
those relating to ERISA, if applicable), seek to adjust or rebalance the portfolios of investment accounts 
and/or private investment clients under management by the Investment Manager or an affiliate (“Advisory 
Clients”) by effecting cross trades between or among such accounts or funds (i.e., causing one or more 
accounts or funds to sell securities to one or more other accounts or funds).  Such transactions may involve 
the Master Fund.  In effecting such cross trades, the Investment Manager seeks to reduce the transaction 
costs of such portfolio adjustments to its Advisory Clients.  All such cross trades will be consistent with the 
investment objectives and policies of each Advisory Cl

Accounts could adversely affect the Fund.  Subject to applicable law and regulations, certain Other 
Accounts may have different operating structures, business terms, regulatory requirements, investment 
guidelines or mandates, or other features that could operate to the disadvantage of the Fund.  For example, 
certain Other Accounts may have different or more frequent investor liquidity than the Fund or trade at a 
higher degree of leverage, which may cause them to liquidate substantial positions at certain times, thereby 
depressing the price of positions in which the Fund is also invested.  Although the Investment Manager will 
only manage any such substantially similar or overlapping Other Accounts if it reasonably determines doing 
so is not reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the Fund under normal market conditions, there can 
be no assurance the Investment Manager’s assessment will be correct.   
Holding Period Requirements for Long-Term Gains 
Non-corporate U.S. persons (including the owner of the Master Fund GP) are subject to U.S. federal 
income tax on long-term capital gain at rates that are substantially lower than the rates applicable to ordinary 
income or short-term capital gain.  In general, gain from the disposition of an investment held by the Master 
Fund for more than one year will be treated as long-term capital gain for Direct Investors (including the 
Investment Manager Parties) but typically not for investors in the Fund.  Under the tax law enacted in 2017, 
the Master Fund GP will recognize short-term capital gain in respect of the Performance Allocation unless 
the Fund’s holding period in the relevant investment is for more than three years.  As a consequence, 
conflicts of interest may arise between the interests of the Master Fund GP and the interests of the 
Shareholders in connection with the Investment Manager’s investment-related determinations.  Such 
determinations include, but are not limited to, decisions with respect to the discovering, evaluating, 
developing, negotiating, structuring, making, acquiring, holding, carrying, restructuring, monitoring, 
managing, disposing and monetizing the Fund’s investments.  The Investment Manager’s strategy is 
designed to achieve gains over longer-term holding periods that, in the case of many positions, will exceed 
the foregoing three-year holding period.  Nonetheless, prospective investors should be aware of the 
potential conflicts that may arise in connection with the Investment Manager’s investment decisions and 
expect that the certain of those determinations may be influenced, in part, by the tax treatment of capital 
gain in respect of the investments of the Investment Manager Parties and the Master Fund GP’s Performance 
Allocation.  
Board Memberships 
Members of the Investment Manager’s portfolio management team may serve, from time to time, 
as directors or officers, or in a similar capacity, with respect to an issuer of securities held by t

and Custodial Arrangements.”  However, even when using “soft dollars” within the safe harbor, the 
Investment Manager will have a conflict of interest between its obligation to seek best execution for the 
Master Fund and its interest in receiving products and services for which it might otherwise have to pay.  
In addition, where the Investment Manager uses “soft dollars” to pay for services that the Master Fund 
would otherwise have to pay for directly, the cost of such services is not as transparent to the Shareholders 
as are direct payments by the Master Fund, which are disclosed in the Fund’s audited financial statements.   
Trade Errors 
The Investment Manager will from time to time make trade errors.  Trade errors are not errors in 
judgment, strategy, market analysis or economic outlook, but rather errors in implementing specific trades 
which the Investment Manager had determined (rightly or wrongly) to make.  Examples of trade errors 
include: (i) buying or selling an investment at a price or quantity that is not intended; or (ii) buying rather 
than selling a particular investment (and vice versa).  Trade errors can result from clerical mistakes, 
miscommunications between Investment Manager personnel and other reasons.  Importantly, however, 
trade errors are not the function of poor strategies, valuation models, economic expectations, undue 
speculation, unauthorized trades, or the like, but rather of the physical implementation of specific trades on 
which the Investment Manager had decided. 
The Investment Manager determines whether to have the costs arising from trade errors borne by 
the client or the Investment Manager by applying the Standard of Care.  The Investment Manager will, 
accordingly, be obligated to reimburse the client for any trade error resulting from the Investment 
Manager’s fraud, gross negligence (having the meaning as defined under the laws of the State of Delaware, 
U.S.A.) or willful misconduct, but not otherwise.  The Investment Manager will itself determine in good 
faith whether or not a given trade error is required to be reimbursed under the Standard of Care.  This 
approach does not contemplate that the Investment Manager would determine whether any individual trade 
error resulted from the Investment Manager’s fraud, gross negligence (having the meaning as defined under 
the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A.) or willful misconduct per se; rather, the Investment Manager 
would likely consider itself to have been grossly negligent if the Investment Manager determines that its 
supervisory procedures were inadequate to prevent such errors from recurring with any frequency.  
The Investment Manager has a conflict of interest in determining whether a trade error should be 
for the account of the client or the Investment Manager and attempts to resolve such conflict by an objective 
determination of the status of such trade error under the applicable liability standard.   
Trade error costs can

in the course of their respective businesses, have potential conflicts of interest with the Fund or the 
shareholders.  The Directors will endeavour to ensure that any conflicts are resolved equitably. 
BROKERAGE AND CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS 
General 
The Master Fund maintains accounts at a prime broker through which the Master Fund may execute 
trades, borrow securities and clear and settle its securities transactions, and the prime broker maintains 
custody of the Master Fund’s financial instruments. A variety of prime brokers, executing brokers, futures 
commission merchants and custodians may be selected by the Investment Manager and retained by the 
Master Fund from time to time (collectively, the “brokers”).  Certain of the Master Fund’s assets held by 
brokers and custodians are segregated from the brokers’ and custodians’ own property, while other Master 
Fund assets held as collateral or margin may not be recoverable in the event of the custodian’s insolvency.   
The Investment Manager uses Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC as the Fund’s prime broker.  However, 
the Investment Manager reserves the right to change the Fund’s brokerage and custodial arrangements 
without prior notice to and without the consent of the Shareholders.  No restrictions have been imposed by 
the Master Fund on the transfer and reuse arrangements that the Master Fund may employ as a means of 
reducing the cost of any counterparty providing financing to the Master Fund. 
Information concerning the Master Fund’s brokers is available from the FINRA website:  
http://brokercheck.finra.org.   
“Soft Dollars” 
The Investment Manager is authorized to determine the broker to be used for each securities 
transaction on behalf of the Master Fund.  In selecting brokers and negotiating commission rates for the 
Master Fund, the Investment Manager takes into account the financial stability and reputation of brokerage 
firms, and the quality of the investment research, special execution capabilities, clearance, settlement, 
custody, recordkeeping and other services provided by the broker, even though the Master Fund may or 
may not in any particular instance be the direct or indirect beneficiary of the research or other services 
provided.  In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions, the Investment Manager need not solicit 
competitive bids and does not have an obligation to seek the lowest available commission cost.  The 
Investment Manager may cause the Master Fund to pay commissions to particular brokers that are higher 
than those charged by other brokers in exchange for products or services provided by the brokers receiving 
higher commissions, although the Investment Manager in any case makes a good faith determination that 
the amount of commissions paid is reasonable in light of the products or services provided by a broker.  
Research services within Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act may include, but are not limited to, the 
following: research reports, includ

trade information; and services required by the SEC or a self-regulatory organization such as comparison 
services, electronic trade confirmations or trade affirmations. 
The Investment Manager generally intends to limit its use of soft dollar services to obtaining 
services that it reasonably believes are consistent with the Section 28(e) safe harbor. However, subject to 
ERISA (if applicable), the Investment Manager from time to time may enter into soft dollar arrangements 
which provide services to the Investment Manager which fall outside of Section 28(e) if the Investment 
Manager believes that doing so is reasonable and in the interests of the Master Fund.   
Research and brokerage services obtained by the use of commissions arising from the Master 
Fund’s portfolio transactions may be used by the Investment Manager in its other investment activities.  
The Master Fund may not necessarily, in any particular instance, be the direct or indirect beneficiary of the 
research or brokerage services provided in consideration of the “soft dollars” generated by the Master 
Fund’s trading. 
Brokers may refer investors to the Investment Manager.  As a result, the Investment Manager has 
an incentive to select or recommend brokers based on such brokers providing client referrals, rather than 
upon the Master Fund’s receiving the most favorable execution from the broker. 
Non-Securities Trading 
Under applicable U.S. securities laws, the concept of “best price and execution” applies only to 
securities trading — in other asset classes (for example, futures, forwards and swap contracts), commissions 
and spreads are solely a matter of negotiation between the trader and the counterparty. 
The Investment Manager negotiates all commission and trading arrangements (as well as interest 
income arrangements in the case of counterparties holding the Master Fund’s assets as collateral) at arm’s 
length and has no affiliation with any of the Master Fund’s brokers or counterparties. 
However, the Investment Manager may receive certain research and related services from such 
counterparties, subject to the same general limitations as set forth above with respect to “soft dollar” 
services received by the Investment Manager as a result of the Master Fund’s trading. 
NET ASSET VALUE 
General 
The Fund’s and the Master Fund’s Gross Asset Value and Net Asset Value (for convenience, both 
are collectively referred to in this section as “Net Asset Value,” unless and only to the extent that the context 
otherwise requires) are calculated as of the end of each calendar month and at such other times as the 
Investment Manager may determine (each, a “Valuation Date”).  The Fund’s Net Asset Value is calculated 
taking into account all assets and liabilities of the Fund, including, without limitation, administration, legal, 
audit and other professional fees and expenses.  Virtually all of the Net Asset Value of the Fund (and of 
each series) consists of the Net Asset Va

Valuation Date of determination or the “official closing price” (if applicable).  If no settlement price or 
trade price of such financial instrument was reported on the applicable Valuation Date, the financial 
instrument will be valued at the mean between the quoted “bid” and “ask” prices on the relevant Valuation 
Date. 
(ii) 
Financial instruments that are not listed on an exchange but are traded over-the-counter 
will be valued at the last reported sales price on the relevant Valuation Date, or, if such price is not available, 
at the mean between the “bid” and “ask” prices on the relevant Valuation Date. 
(iii) 
Options that are listed on an options exchange shall be valued at their last sale price on the 
principal market on which such options will have traded on such date; provided, that if the last sale price 
of such options does not fall within the last “bid” and “asked” price for such options on such date, the 
options will be valued at the mean between the last “bid” and “asked” price for such options on the 
Valuation Date. 
(iv)  
Forward, spot and swap contracts and other off-exchange instruments will be valued at the 
latest settlement price obtained from a reputable market participant or pricing service, which may include 
the counterparty to the transaction, or by reference to the relevant underlying instruments. 
(v) 
Short-term money market instruments and bank deposits are valued at cost plus accrued 
interest to date. 
(vi) 
Other assets and liabilities for which observable inputs are not readily available will be 
valued at their fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with ASC 820 under the procedures 
adopted by the Investment Manager. 
In determining the liabilities of the Master Fund, the Master Fund GP may calculate expenses of a 
regular or recurring nature (including, but not limited to, legal and audit services and other expenses) for 
any given period on an estimated basis in advance, and may accrue the same in such manner as the Master 
Fund GP may deem appropriate over such period. 
The Master Fund GP determines the manner of applying the foregoing valuation principles in 
circumstances in which they are unclear or not equitable, and the Master Fund GP also determines the 
manner of applying such principles in circumstances in which more than one method of application would 
be equitable or consistent with Law.  The Master Fund GP may also determine to use a different value for 
any investment than would be assigned pursuant to paragraphs (i) to (vi) above if the Master Fund GP 
determines that to do so would more accurately reflect market value.  The foregoing valuation principles 
may be modified as necessary in the Master Fund GP’s sole discretion if the Master Fund GP determines 
doing so would better reflect market value, either in specific circumstances or generally. 
The Master Fund GP is absolutely protected in relying on the valuations furnished to the Investment 
Manager by third par

Net Asset Value is calculated by the Administrator in accordance with such valuation principles 
and valuations provided by the Investment Manager and third parties, subject to the ultimate oversight and 
authority of the Directors (in the case of the Fund) and the Master Fund GP (in the case of the Master Fund).  
However, during any time that the underlying assets of the Master Fund are considered for purposes of 
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code to be “plan assets,” neither the Master Fund GP nor the Investment 
Manager will use its discretion to calculate the Net Asset Value of the Master Fund.  
Suspending the Determination of Net Asset Value 
The Directors may suspend the determination of Net Asset Value as of any Valuation Date, as well 
as the associated effective dates for Dividends and Redemptions, if the Directors determine that, as of such 
Valuation Date, a material portion of the Fund’s portfolio cannot be reliably or accurately valued.  In such 
event, the Fund will give notice as soon as reasonably practicable of any such suspension to all 
Shareholders. 
The Directors may suspend the determination of Net Asset Value with respect to part but not all of 
the Fund’s portfolio if the Directors determine that such part cannot be reliably or accurately valued — in 
which case the Investment Manager will continue to value the remainder of the Fund’s portfolio. 
The Master Fund GP may suspend the determination of the Master Fund’s Net Asset Value and 
withdrawals by the Fund under the same circumstances (which would result in the Directors doing the same 
in respect of the Fund). 
REDEMPTIONS 
Redemptions 
Subject to the applicable Monthly Redemption Allowance (as described below under “—Monthly 
Redemption Allowance”), a Shareholder generally may redeem Shares (a “Redemption”) from the Fund 
as of the end of each calendar month (a “Redemption Date”) upon at least (x) sixty (60) days’ prior written 
notice, with respect to Founders Shares, and (y) ninety (90) days’ prior written notice, with respect to B 
Shares or C Shares.  
Redemption requests should specify the proposed Redemption Date and either a percentage of the 
Net Asset Value of the redeeming Shareholder’s Shares or an absolute U.S. Dollar amount of such Shares 
to be redeemed.  The Administrator will use reasonable efforts to acknowledge in writing all Redemption 
requests which are received in good order. A Shareholder failing to receive such written acknowledgement 
from the Administrator within five (5) business days should contact the Administrator to obtain the same. 
Failure to obtain such a written acknowledgement from the Administrator may render the request void, 
unless otherwise permitted by the Investment Manager. 
If a Shareholder holds multiple series of Shares, redemptions will be made from the series of Shares 
so designated by the redeeming Shareholder or, in the absence of such election, on a “first in, first out” or 
pro rata basis, as determined by

Lock-Up Period for C Shares 
The C Shares are subject to a “hard” lock-up period that begins on the Subscription Date of a 
Shareholder’s initial subscription to the Fund for C Shares and ends on the twenty-fourth (24th) month-end 
following such Subscription Date, during which time such Shareholder will not be permitted to make a 
Redemption in respect of its C Shares (the “C Shares Lock-Up Period”). 
Monthly Redemption Allowance 
The maximum amount a Shareholder can redeem from the Fund as of any monthly Redemption 
Date equals the “Monthly Redemption Allowance” in effect for such Redemption Date.   
Initially, with respect to Founders Shares, a Shareholder’s Monthly Redemption Allowance equals 
one-twelfth (1/12) of such Shareholder’s Founders Shares.  If a Shareholder redeems the maximum 1/12 
Monthly Redemption Allowance of its Founders Shares as of a Redemption Date, such Shareholder’s 
maximum Monthly Redemption Allowance is increased to 1/11, 1/10, 1/9, 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 
and 1/1 of the remaining Founders Shares as of the next eleven Redemption Dates on which such 
Shareholder redeems capital, respectively, which need not be consecutive Redemption Dates, subject to, in 
each case, the Redemption Reset (as defined below).   
Initially, with respect to B Shares, a Shareholder’s Monthly Redemption Allowance equals one-
twenty-fourth (1/24) of such Shareholder’s B Shares.  If a Shareholder redeems the maximum 1/24 Monthly 
Redemption Allowance of its B Shares as of a Redemption Date, such Shareholder’s maximum Monthly 
Redemption Allowance is increased to 1/23, 1/22, 1/21, 1/20, 1/19, 1/18, 1/17, 1/16, 1/15, 1/14, 1/13, 1/12, 
1/11, 1/10, 1/9, 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1/1 of the remaining B Shares as of the next twenty-three 
Redemption Dates on which such Shareholder redeems capital, respectively, which need not be consecutive 
Redemption Dates, subject to, in each case, the Redemption Reset.  
Initially, with respect C Shares, a Shareholder’s Monthly Redemption Allowance following the 
conclusion of the C Shares Lock-Up Period for such subscription equals one-eighteenth (1/18) of its C 
Shares.  If a Shareholder redeems the maximum 1/18 Monthly Redemption Allowance of its C Shares as 
of a Redemption Date, such Shareholder’s maximum Monthly Redemption Allowance is increased to 1/17, 
1/16, 1/15, 1/14, 1/13, 1/12, 1/11, 1/10, 1/9, 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1/1 of the remaining C 
Shares as of the next seventeen Redemption Dates on which such Shareholder redeems capital, respectively, 
which need not be consecutive Redemption Dates, subject to, in each case, the Redemption Reset. 
However, redeeming Shareholders may only elect not to redeem any Shares as of any one or any 
two consecutive Redemption Dates — but not three or more consecutive Redemption Dates — without 
triggering the Redemption Reset. 
The Monthly Redemption Allowance has been designed to permit a Shareholder to fully redeem

The intent of the Fund’s Redemption terms is approximately to correlate the longer-term nature of 
the Fund’s investment strategy, as well as the liquidity of the Fund’s portfolio, with the investor liquidity 
made available to Shareholders, as well as to facilitate an orderly reduction of positions to cash over time 
(avoiding the potential for portfolio damage that could be caused by the more expedited liquidation of 
positions).  Consistent with this purpose, any portion of a Shareholder’s Shares that cannot be redeemed 
due to the operation of the Monthly Redemption Allowance will remain invested and continue to participate 
in the gains and losses of the Fund. 
For the avoidance of doubt, if a Shareholder (i) does not redeem the maximum Monthly 
Redemption Allowance as of a Redemption Date; (ii) makes a new subscription to the Fund; or (iii) does 
not redeem any Shares for three consecutive Redemption Dates, such Shareholder’s Monthly Redemption 
Allowance will remain at or be “reset” to 1/12 of such Shareholder’s remaining Founders Shares, 1/24 of 
such Shareholder’s remaining B Shares or 1/18 of such Shareholder’s remaining C Shares, as applicable 
(the “Redemption Reset”) (whereupon such Shareholder will only be able to completely redeem from the 
Fund over the course of twelve, twenty-four or eighteen Redemption Dates, as applicable, irrespective of 
any Redemptions previously made). 
If a Shareholder holds multiple series of Shares, redemptions will be made from the series of Shares 
so designated by the redeeming Shareholder or, in the absence of such election, on a “first in, first out” or 
pro rata basis, as determined by the Investment Manager. Similarly, if a Shareholder holds more than one 
Sub-Series of Shares of the same series, Shares will be redeemed on a “first in, first out” or pro rata basis, 
as determined by the Investment Manager.  For the avoidance of doubt, if a Shareholder holds more than 
one Sub-Series with different Net Asset Values per Share, the Monthly Redemption Allowance will be 
applied based on the aggregate Net Asset Value of all Shares held by such Shareholder (and not the number 
of Shares held).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, C Shares will also be redeemed on a “first in, first out” 
basis with the Monthly Redemption Allowance calculated in respect of each Sub-Series (and not across a 
Shareholder’s multiple Sub-Series). 
The Investment Manager may waive the Monthly Redemption Allowance, but does not intend to 
do so except in circumstances it considers exceptional.  Any such waiver granted to a Shareholder shall not 
entitle any other Shareholder to a similar waiver. 
Effect of Redemptions 
Where a redemption request is accepted, the Shares will be treated as having been redeemed with 
effect from the relevant Redemption Date irrespective of whether or not such redeeming Shareholder has 
been removed from the Fund’s register of shareholders, the redemption reflected in the Fund’s record of 
Subsc

Redemptions by Investment Manager Parties 
Investments in the Linonia Partners Funds by Investment Manager Parties are generally subject to 
the same restrictions on Redemptions as are all other Shareholders holding Founders Shares, including the 
Monthly Redemption Allowance.  However, the Master Fund GP (and other Investment Manager Parties, 
as the case may be) may withdraw all or any portion of its Master Fund Account balance that is ultimately 
attributable to Performance Allocations (except, for the avoidance of doubt, the Series A1 Restricted 
Performance Allocation or the Series A2 Restricted Performance Allocation) at any time without notice to 
Shareholders and without being subject to the Monthly Redemption Allowance.  Upon the completion of 
the calendar year immediately following the year in which the amount of a Performance Allocation was 
crystallized, any amounts attributable to a Performance Allocation will be subject to the Founder Shares 
liquidity terms.  Investment Manager Parties may also at any time and without limitation withdraw the 
amount of any estimated or actual federal, state and local taxes payable by such Investment Manager Party 
with respect to taxable income and gain incurred during a fiscal year (“Tax Distributions”).   
The Principal — Mr. Philip Uhde — has invested a substantial portion of his liquid net worth in 
the Master Fund.  Although the Principal generally intends to maintain such investment during the life of 
the Fund, the Principal may redeem capital from the Linonia Partners Funds according to the Founders 
Shares terms, except that he may redeem on any Redemption Date on less than 60 days’ prior notice up to 
$2 million in the Linonia Partners Funds in the aggregate during each calendar year. For the avoidance of 
doubt, the Principal’s investments in the Linonia Partners Funds have been or may be made either directly 
by the Principal or indirectly through the Master Fund GP, the Investment Manager, family investment 
vehicles controlled by the Principal, and tax and estate planning vehicles organized for the benefit of the 
Principal and/or his family members (collectively, “Managing Principal Investments”).  Accordingly, the 
foregoing notice and withdrawal provisions relating to the Principal’s investments in the Linonia Partners 
Funds refer to all Managing Principal Investments over which the Principal has control in the aggregate, as 
though they were a single investment made directly by the Managing Principal in his individual capacity. 
Certain Investment Manager Parties may be required to invest in the Fund through or in connection 
with a compensation or mandatory reinvestment plan.  As particular installments of such investments “vest” 
and become eligible to be redeemed under the compensation plan, such installments may then be redeemed 
without being subject to the Fund’s regular Redemption terms or restrictions (including the Monthly 
Redemption Allowance).

A “Key Person Event” will occur if the Principal (i) dies, (ii) is unable, by reason of illness or 
injury, to perform his functions for the Investment Manager for a period of 45 days during any consecutive 
180-day period, (iii) for any reason other than death, illness or injury, ceases to devote substantially all of 
his business time to the day-to-day activities of the Investment Manager (which, for the avoidance of doubt, 
would not be triggered by reasonable vacation time) or (iv) is no longer primarily responsible for the 
management of the Fund’s portfolio. 
Key Person Event Redemptions are not subject to the Monthly Redemption Allowance or the C 
Shares Lock-Up Period (if applicable), but remain subject to all other terms applicable to Redemptions 
generally (except as otherwise specifically set forth above with respect to Key Person Event Redemptions). 
Depending on the level of Redemption Requests following a Key Person Event (and the Fund’s 
ability to satisfy them), the Fund may establish certain “special liquidation vehicles,” offer Distributions in 
kind to certain investors, arrange auctions of Shares and/or Fund assets or take such other actions as the 
Investment Manager may determine.  Priority considerations for the Investment Manager in structuring the 
Key Person Event Redemption rights will be preserving value, whether the Fund will dissolve or continue 
in operation and expedite Redemptions for those Shareholders who elect to redeem. 
Payment of Redemption Proceeds 
Redemption proceeds are generally paid within thirty (30) days of the applicable Redemption Date 
or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter; provided, that the Fund may, but has no obligation to, “hold 
back” up to 5% of the total estimated Redemption proceeds otherwise payable to a Shareholder in respect 
of Redemptions made during a single fiscal year until the completion of the Fund’s annual audit for the 
fiscal year in which the Redemption was effective. The Fund generally does not intend to retain an audit 
holdback of estimated Redemption proceeds unless a Shareholder has redeemed a substantial majority of 
its Shares during a particular fiscal year, but may (or may not) do so under any circumstance in its discretion.   
Redemption proceeds payable to redeeming Shareholders (including any “holdback”) are held as a 
general asset of the Fund pending payment and do not participate in the profits or losses of the Fund 
following the applicable Redemption Date, nor do they accrue any interest.   
Redemption proceeds are generally paid in cash (by bank-to-bank wire transfer) to an account in 
the name of the redeeming Shareholder.  The Administrator will not remit any Redemption proceeds to a 
third party account without its prior consent, which may be withheld in its discretion.  However, 
Redemption proceeds may be paid in kind, in whole or in part, as determined by the Directors.   
In light of the expectation that the Master Fund’s portfolio wi

been removed from the Fund’s register of Shareholders or the Redemption price has been determined or 
remitted.  Accordingly, on and from the relevant Redemption Date, Shareholders in their capacity as such 
will not be entitled to or be capable of exercising any rights arising under the Articles with respect to Shares 
being redeemed (including any right to receive notice of, attend or vote at any meeting of the Fund) save 
the right to receive the Redemption price and any Dividend which has been declared prior to the relevant 
Redemption Date but not yet paid (in each case with respect to the Shares being redeemed).  Such redeemed 
Shareholders will be creditors of the Fund with respect to the Redemption price.  In an insolvent liquidation, 
redeemed Shareholders will rank behind ordinary creditors but ahead of Shareholders. 
Payments In Kind 
The Fund intends to pay all Redemption proceeds and Dividends in cash. However, if the Master 
Fund transfers assets in kind to the Fund, the Directors may, including at the request of the recipient 
Shareholder and subject to ERISA (if applicable), cause the Fund to pay Redemption proceeds and/or 
Dividends in kind, in whole or in part, in lieu of cash based on an in-kind distribution by the Master Fund. 
In the unlikely event that the Master Fund determines to pay out a Redemption or Dividend to the 
Fund — and the Fund, in turn, determines to pay out such Redemption or Dividend to one or more 
Shareholders — in whole or in part, in kind rather than in cash, the Directors will use commercially 
reasonable efforts to give affected Shareholders at least ten (10) days’ notice of the proposed in-kind 
payment (generally describing the assets to be distributed and any associated liabilities assumed).  If the 
Shareholder notifies the Fund within five (5) days of receipt of such notice from the Directors that receipt 
of the in-kind assets (or associated liabilities) intended to be paid out to such Shareholder could reasonably 
be expected to cause such Shareholder to be in violation of any law or the internal policies of such 
Shareholder, the Directors will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Fund (or the Master Fund 
on the Fund’s behalf) to sell the in-kind assets intended to be distributed — which sale may be made without 
reference to market or most recent prices, or to an Investment Manager Party (any sale to an Investment 
Manager Party to require the consent of such Shareholder).  In such case, neither the Directors nor the 
Investment Manager need make any representation as to how long a delay there might be before such sale 
will be effected and whether there will be a single sale for the entirety of such assets or more than one sale, 
each for a part of such assets.  No interest will accrue on any amounts due to the affected Shareholder 
pending such sale(s); provided, that the Investment Manager will cause the Master Fund to distribute the 
proceeds of such sale(s) to the Fund

Master Fund: (i) not to qualify for any applicable exclusion from registration as an “investment company” 
under the Company Act; (ii) not to qualify for any applicable exclusion from, or exemption promulgated 
under, the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, as amended; or (iii) to violate any Law or contractual provision. 
No Redemption requests are effective if, on or before the intended Redemption Date for the 
requested Redemption, the Directors determine to dissolve the Fund or reduce its portfolio to cash. 
Suspending Effective Dates 
The Directors will suspend the effective date of a Redemption or Dividend (as applicable, an 
“Effective Date”), regardless of the actual date of payment if the determination of Net Asset Value and, 
accordingly, the applicable Valuation Date have been suspended.   
The Directors may suspend an Effective Date if the Directors determine: (i) the Fund’s investments 
are committed in such a manner so as not reasonably to permit immediate liquidation of sufficient funds; 
(ii) there exists a state of affairs that the Directors determine constitutes circumstances under which 
liquidation by the Fund of part or all of its investments is not reasonable or practicable, or would be 
prejudicial to the Fund; (iii) not suspending such Effective Date could have a material adverse effect on the 
continuing Shareholders; (iv) not suspending such Effective Date would result in an Impermissible Event; 
or (v) to dissolve the Fund.  The Master Fund GP may suspend the determination of the Master Fund’s Net 
Asset Value and withdrawals by the Fund under the same circumstances (which would result in the 
Directors doing the same in respect of the Fund). 
In the event that an Effective Date is suspended, all pending Redemption requests will be rescinded, 
and no additional Redemption requests will be accepted until the suspension has ended.  If an Effective 
Date is suspended, Shares in such Shareholder’s Sub-Series that would otherwise have been redeemed as 
of such Effective Date continue to participate in the gains and losses of the Fund. 
When Redemptions are resumed after an Effective Date has been suspended, no Redemption 
requests will have any priority over any other Redemption requests (whether previously submitted and 
subsequently revoked due to such suspension or otherwise) and the Fund’s ordinary Redemption protocol 
(including the Monthly Redemption Allowance) will resume as if no suspension had occurred.   
Redemptions may be suspended with respect to part, but not all, of the Fund’s portfolio, in which 
event outstanding Redemption requests will be rescinded only to the extent that they relate to the portion 
of the Fund’s portfolio from which Redemptions are suspended. The Fund may issue a special Class or 
Series of Shares to Shareholders representing their pro rata participation in such portion of the Fund’s 
assets or take such other action as the Directors determine equitable under the circumstances.

Suspending the Payment of Redemption Proceeds 
Even if a Redemption Date has not itself been suspended, the Directors may suspend the payment 
of Redemption proceeds if the Directors determine that: (i) making such payment would result in an 
Impermissible Event; or (ii) liquidating investments to pay Redemption Proceeds could have a material 
adverse effect on the continuing Shareholders (for example, if the corresponding liquidation of the Fund’s 
outstanding positions could cause significant portfolio damage).   
Dividends 
As a general matter, the Investment Manager intends to reinvest the income and capital gains of 
the Master Fund.  The Master Fund GP and the Directors, respectively, do not intend to cause the Master 
Fund or the Fund to make Distributions.  However, the Directors generally will cause the Fund to pay 
Dividends to the Shareholders if the Master Fund makes a distribution to the Fund. Dividends, if paid, need 
not be paid pro rata among the Shareholders.  Any Dividend paid to a Shareholder decreases the Net Asset 
Value of such Shareholder’s Sub-Series and is treated as a Redemption for Performance Allocation 
purposes and determining Proportionate Shares.  Dividends may be rescinded by the Directors at any time 
after announcement and prior to their Effective Date, and are subject to suspension under the same 
circumstances as Redemptions.   
Transfers 
Shares may be Transferred only upon the execution and delivery of a Subscription Agreement (or 
other written instrument satisfactory to and accepted by the Fund) by the transferee and on such terms as 
are acceptable to the Directors.  No Transfer will be effective if the transferee is not qualified to become a 
Shareholder or without the written consent of the Directors.   
Transfers to new beneficial owners generally will be treated as a Redemption by the transferor 
(subject to Performance Allocations, if due) and a new Subscription by the transferee.  The foregoing will 
result in the resetting of the C Shares Lock-Up Period for transfers of C Shares, such that the transferee’s 
C Shares will be subject to a new C Shares Lock-Up Period.  However, the Investment Manager may 
determine to treat the transferee as if it were the alter ego of the transferor for one or more purposes 
(including in respect of Performance Allocations) and generally intends to do so upon request if the 
transferee is a Related Investor (as defined below) (as determined by the Investment Manager in its sole 
discretion). 
Upon a Transfer of Founders Shares, unless such Transfer is made to a Related Investor, Founders’ 
Shares will lose their classification as such, and the transferred Shares will be converted (by way of 
redemption and subscription) into (and become subject to the terms, including Management Fees and 
Performance Allocations applicable to) a Sub-Series of the series of B Shares corresponding to the Founders 
Shares held by the transferor as of the Transfer date, as determin

The discussion below is a general summary of certain tax considerations currently applicable 
to the Fund and the Master Fund, and to an investment therein by certain prospective Shareholders.  
In view of the number of different jurisdictions where local laws may apply to a Shareholder of the 
Fund, this Memorandum does not discuss the non-United States tax consequences (other than the tax 
consequences with respect to the Cayman Islands) to a potential investor arising from the acquisition, 
holding or disposition of Shares.  
EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CONSULT WITH AND MUST RELY 
UPON HIS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF INVESTING 
IN THE FUND.  THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED ONLY TO ASSIST THE PROSPECTIVE 
INVESTOR IN EVALUATING THE EXPECTED TAX CONSEQUENCES AND LIABILITIES 
RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND.  A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL TAX 
ASPECTS OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS

TAX CONSEQUENCES OR LIABILITIES RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND BY

United States 
The following is a summary of certain aspects of the U.S. federal income taxation of the Master 
Fund, the Fund and its Shareholders that should be considered by a prospective investor.  This summary is 
based on the U.S. federal income tax laws, regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions in 
effect or available on the date of this Memorandum.  No assurance can be given that administrative, judicial 
or legislative changes will not occur that would make the statements herein incorrect or incomplete.  This 
summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a particular investor or to 
certain investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws.  In addition, this 
summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to an investment in the 
Fund by persons other than non-resident alien individuals, foreign corporations and U.S. tax-exempt 
organizations.  Each prospective investor should consult its own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal 
income tax consequences of an investment in the Fund. 
The Master Fund and the Fund   
The Master Fund has elected to be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  
The Fund will be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  As a foreign corporation, 
the Fund generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on income or gain realized by it from 
trading and investment activities; provided, that the Fund is not engaged in, or deemed to be engaged in, a 
U.S. trade or business to which such income or gain is treated as effectively connected.  If the Master Fund 
is engaged in, or deemed to be engaged in, a U.S. trade or business in a

Master Fund nor the Fund can give complete assurance that it will not be treated as conducting a trade or 
business within the United States, it should be noted that if the Fund were engaged in, or deemed to be 
engaged in, a U.S. trade or business in any year, the Fund (but not any of the Shareholders) would be 
required to file a U.S. federal income tax return for such year and pay tax on its income and gain that is 
effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business at U.S. corporate tax rates.  In addition, the Fund 
generally would be required to pay a branch profits tax equal to 30% of the earnings and profits of such 
U.S. trade or business that are not reinvested therein. 
Due to the pass-through nature of the Master Fund, the term “the Fund” (as used in the remainder 
of this summary) may include the Master Fund through which the Fund trades as the context may require. 
The Fund also will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax on the gross amount of (i) any U.S. 
source interest income that falls outside the portfolio interest exception or other available exception to 
withholding tax, (ii) any U.S. source dividend income or dividend equivalent payments, and (iii) any other 
U.S. source fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income, in each case to the extent 
such amounts are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.  For these purposes, interest will 
generally qualify for the portfolio interest exception if it is paid on an obligation that is in registered form; 
provided, that the Master Fund and the Fund provide certain required certifications, or in certain other 
circumstances.  However, interest on an obligation will not qualify for the portfolio interest exception if (i) 
the Fund is considered a 10% shareholder of the issuer of the obligation, (ii) the Fund is a controlled foreign 
corporation and is considered to be a related person with respect to the issuer of the obligation or (iii) such 
interest is determined by reference to certain financial information of the issuer of the obligation (e.g., the 
issuer’s receipts, sales, income or profits) or is otherwise considered to be contingent interest.   
Taxation of Shareholders 
Non-U.S. Shareholders 
Shareholders that are non-resident alien individuals or foreign corporations generally should not be 
subject to U.S. federal income taxation on gain realized from the sale, exchange, or Redemption of Shares 
held as a capital asset unless such gain is otherwise effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or, 
in the case of a non-resident alien individual, such individual is present in the United States for 183 days or 
more during a taxable year and certain other conditions are met.  
U.S. Tax-Exempt Shareholders 
Income or gain realized on an investment in the Fund by a U.S. tax-exempt Shareholder should not 
be taxable as unrelated business taxable income; provided, that such Shareholder does not incur acquisition

to consult their own legal advisors regarding these potential reporting obligations and any other potential 
reporting obligations that may arise from an investment in the Fund. 
Compliance with FATCA 
The U.S. legislation commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) 
generally imposes a 30% withholding tax on certain payments to non-U.S. financial institutions (including 
investment entities) of U.S. source income unless the non-U.S. financial institution discloses to the IRS the 
name, address and taxpayer identification number of certain U.S. persons that hold, directly or indirectly, 
an account with the non-U.S. financial institution, as well as certain other information relating to any such 
account.  The United States and the Cayman Islands have entered into a “Model 1” intergovernmental 
agreement with respect to FATCA (the “US IGA”).  The US IGA modifies the foregoing requirements with 
respect to Cayman financial institutions but generally requires similar information to be disclosed to the 
Cayman Islands government and ultimately to the IRS.  The Fund and the Master Fund intend to comply 
with any obligations imposed on them under FATCA and the US IGA to avoid the imposition on them of 
any withholding tax under FATCA, but there can be no assurances that they will be successful in this regard.  
See “— Cayman Islands — Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information.”   
Cayman Islands 
The Government of the Cayman Islands will not, under existing legislation, impose any income, 
corporate or capital gains tax, estate duty, inheritance tax, gift tax or withholding tax upon the Fund or the 
Shareholders.  The Cayman Islands are not party to a double tax treaty with any country that is applicable 
to any payments made to or by the Fund or the Master Fund. 
The Fund received an undertaking from the Financial Secretary of the Cayman Islands that, in 
accordance with section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 
twenty (20) years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing 
any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to the Fund or its operations and, 
in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of 
estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of the shares, debentures or other 
obligations of the Fund or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or 
other distribution of income or capital by the Fund to its members or a payment of principal or interest or 
other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of the Fund.

requirement would apply under CRS.  The Fund does not propose to rely on any Non-Reporting Financial 
Institution exemption and therefore intends to comply with all of the requirements of the AEOI Regulations. 

The AEOI Regulations require the Fund to, amongst other things (i) register with the IRS to obtain 
a Global Intermediary Identification Number (in the context of the US IGA only), (ii) register with the TIA, 
and thereby notify the TIA of its status as a “Reporting Financial Institution”; (iii) adopt and implement 
written policies and procedures setting out how it will address its obligations under CRS; (iv) conduct due 
diligence on its accounts to identify whether any such accounts are considered “Reportable Accounts,” (v) 
report information on such Reportable Accounts to TIA and (vi) file a CRS Compliance Form with the TIA.  
The TIA will transmit the information reported to it to the overseas fiscal authority relevant to a reportable 
account (i.e., the IRS in the case of a US Reportable Account) annually on an automatic basis.   

By investing in the Fund and/or continuing to invest in the Fund, investors shall be deemed to 
acknowledge that further information may need to be provided to the Fund, the Fund’s compliance with the 
AEOI Regulations may result in the disclosure of investor information, and investor information may be 
exchanged with overseas fiscal authorities.  Where an investor fails to provide any requested information 
(regardless of the consequences), the Fund may be obliged, and/or reserves the right to take any action 
and/or pursue all remedies at its disposal including, without limitation, compulsory redemption or 
withdrawal of the investor concerned and/or closure of the investor’s account.  In accordance with TIA-
issued guidance, the Fund is required to close an investor’s account if a self-certification is not obtained 
within 90 days of the account opening. 
Other Jurisdictions 
Dividends and certain types of interest income on various investments held by the Fund will be 
subject to withholding tax at their source.  Certain gains earned by the Fund or the Master Fund on its 
investments in various jurisdictions outside the Cayman Islands may also be subject to tax in such 
jurisdictions.  The Fund and the Master Fund invest globally.  The activities of the Fund, the Master Fund 
and/or the Investment Manager and its affiliates could subject the Fund and the Master Fund (and, 
potentially, certain Shareholders) to tax in one or more jurisdictions.  Any such tax could apply to all Fund 
income, not only that derived from the jurisdiction asserting such tax.

The following section sets forth certain consequences under ERISA and the Code, which a fiduciary 
of an “employee benefit plan,” as defined in, and subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of, 
ERISA, or of a “plan,” as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code, who has investment discretion 
should consider before deciding to invest such plan’s assets in the Fund (such “employee benefit plans” 
and “plans” being collectively referred to herein as “Plans,” and such fiduciaries with investment discretion 
being referred to herein as “Plan Fiduciaries”).  Furthermore, all potential investors should read the 
following disclosure because it describes certain limitations on the operation of the Fund that may result 
from Plans purchasing Shares.  The following summary is not intended to be complete, but is intended only 
to address certain questions under ERISA and the Code which are likely to be raised by the Plan Fiduciary’s 
own counsel. 
In general, the terms “employee benefit plan” as defined in ERISA and “plan” as defined in Section 
4975 of the Code together refer to any plan or account of various types which provides retirement benefits 
or welfare benefits to an individual or to an employer’s employees and their beneficiaries.  Such plans and 
accounts include, but are not limited to, corporate pension and profit-sharing plans, “simplified employee 
pension plans,” Keogh plans for self-employed individuals (including partners), individual retirement 
accounts described in Section 408 of the Code and medical benefit plans. 
Each Plan Fiduciary must give appropriate consideration to the facts and circumstances that are 
relevant to an investment in the Fund, including the role an investment in the Fund plays in the Plan’s 
investment portfolio.  Each Plan Fiduciary, before deciding to invest in the Fund, must be satisfied that an 
investment in the Fund is a prudent investment for the Plan, that the investments of the Plan, including the 
investment in the Fund, are diversified so as to minimize the risks of large losses, that an investment in the 
Fund complies with the documents of the Plan and related trust and that an investment in the Fund does not 
give rise to a transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. 
EACH PLAN FIDUCIARY CONSIDERING ACQUIRING SHARES MUST CONSULT ITS 
OWN LEGAL AND TAX ADVISORS BEFORE DOING SO. 
Ineligible Purchasers 
In general, Shares may not be purchased with the assets of a Plan if the Investment Manager, any 
Director, the Master Fund GP, any placement agent, or any of their respective affiliates or employees either:  
(i) has investment discretion with respect to the investment of such Plan assets; (ii) provides investment 
advice with respect to such Plan assets for a fee, as described in regulations under ERISA; or (iii) is an 
employer maintaining or contributing to such Plan.  A party that is described in clause (i) or (ii) of the 
preceding sentenc

Shares: (i) Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14 applicable to certain transactions 
involving qualified professional asset managers, (ii) PTCE 96-23 applicable to certain transactions 
involving in-house asset managers, (iii) PTCE 90-1 applicable to certain transactions involving insurance 
company pooled separate accounts, (iv) PTCE 91-38 applicable to certain transactions involving bank 
collective investment funds, (v) PTCE 95-60 applicable to certain transactions involving insurance 
company general accounts or (vi) the service provider exemption provided by Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA 
and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code. 
Plan Assets 
The purchase of Shares by a Plan raises the issue of whether that purchase will, for purposes of 
Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, cause the underlying assets of the Fund and/or the Master 
Fund to be assets of such Plan.  ERISA and a regulation issued thereunder contain rules for determining 
when an investment by a Plan in an entity will result in the underlying assets of such entity being assets of 
the Plan for purposes of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (“Plan Assets”).  Those rules provide that 
assets of an entity will not be Plan Assets of a Plan which purchases an interest therein if the investment by 
all “benefit plan investors” is not “significant” or certain other exceptions apply.  The term “benefit plan 
investors” includes all Plans (i.e., all “employee benefit plans” as defined in, and subject to the fiduciary 
responsibility provisions of, ERISA and all “plans” as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code) 
and all entities that hold Plan Assets (each, a “Plan Assets Entity”) due to investments made in such entities 
by already described benefit plan investors.  ERISA provides that a Plan Assets Entity is considered to hold 
Plan Assets only to the extent of the percentage of the Plan Assets Entity’s equity interests held by benefit 
plan investors.  Investments by benefit plan investors will be deemed not significant if benefit plan investors 
own, in the aggregate, less than 25% of the total value of each class of equity interests of the entity 
(determined without including the investments of persons with discretionary authority or control over the 
assets of such entity, any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect 
to such assets, and “affiliates,” as defined in the regulations issued under ERISA, of such persons; provided, 
however, that under no circumstances are investments by benefit plan investors excluded from such 
calculation).  The 25% test must be applied after any acquisition or Redemption of Shares. 
A Plan Fiduciary considering the purchase of Shares on behalf of a Plan and all other persons 
considering the purchase of Shares should be aware that at such time, if any, that benefit plan investors own 
25% or more of the total value of any class of equity interest in the Fund, the under

assets of the Fund and/or the Master Fund, as applicable, will be considered Plan Assets.  The following 
consequences with respect to the Master Fund will result during the time that the underlying assets of the 
Master Fund are considered to be Plan Assets.  Even if benefit plan investors do not own 25% or more of 
the total value of any class of equity interests of the Fund, the consequences described below may limit the 
Fund’s investment activities because the Fund’s investment and trading activities are conducted by the 
Master Fund.   
During any time that the total value of each class of equity interest of the Master Fund is owned 
less than 25% by benefit plan investors, the provisions of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, 
and the consequences described below, will not apply to the Master Fund even if 25% or more of the total 
value of any class of equity interest of the Fund is held by benefit plan investors. 
Fiduciary Duties 
If the underlying assets of both the Fund and the Master Fund are Plan Assets, the Investment 
Manager (as the party with discretionary authority and control over the investment of the Master Fund’s 
assets) will be a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to the assets of Plan investors indirectly held by the 
Master Fund through the Fund, and the Investment Manager’s duties and liabilities with respect to such 
assets will be subject to the provisions of ERISA.  Generally, the fiduciary provisions of ERISA require 
fiduciaries to act for the exclusive benefit of participants and beneficiaries of the Plan, to employ the care, 
skill, prudence and diligence that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters 
would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, to diversify investments so 
as to minimize the risks of large losses, and to comply with the plan and trust documents of the Plan. 
As a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act, the Investment Manager qualifies as an 
investment manager of each Plan investor subject to ERISA; provided, that the Investment Manager 
acknowledges in writing that it is a fiduciary to such Plan investor and a named fiduciary of the Plan 
properly appoints the Investment Manager as an investment manager with respect to the Plan as provided 
in the Subscription Agreement.  If the Investment Manager is so appointed by a named fiduciary, or a 
fiduciary acting pursuant to the proper delegation of authority from a named fiduciary, and acknowledges 
in writing that it is a fiduciary with respect to the Plan, the Plan Fiduciaries with discretion to invest in the 
Fund will only be liable with respect to the decision to appoint and retain the Investment Manager as a 
fiduciary with authority to manage the assets of the Fund (indirectly through the Master Fund) and other 
Plan Fiduciaries generally will not be liable for the acts and omissions of the Investment Manager.  
However, Plan Fiduciaries will be

Investment Manager will be prohibited from entering into any transaction or engaging in any activity if 
such transaction or activity is prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. 
In addition to the prohibited transactions discussed above, Section 406(a)(1)(E) of ERISA prohibits 
a fiduciary from causing a plan to acquire any employer securities that are not “qualifying employer 
securities” or to hold “qualifying employer securities” in excess of the limits described in Section 407 of 
ERISA.  The Investment Manager will not take steps to determine whether any security acquired by the 
Master Fund constitutes an employer security of any Plan investor.  Moreover, because the limits on 
investment in qualifying employer securities described in Section 407 of ERISA apply to the Plan’s entire 
portfolio, the Investment Manager will not monitor, or be responsible for, a Plan investor’s compliance 
with such investment limits.  Therefore, each Plan Fiduciary that causes the Plan to invest in the Fund will 
be responsible for ensuring compliance with these rules. 
The Investment Manager is aware of several prohibited transaction exemptions that may apply to 
the transactions of the Fund and, during any time that the assets of the Fund constitute Plan Assets, intends 
to ensure that the Fund’s transactions are covered by one or more applicable exemptions.  For example, 
Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 84-14 (the “QPAM Exemption”) issued by the U.S. Department 
of Labor (“DOL”) exempts most types of transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under 
Section 406(a) of ERISA if such transactions are entered into by a “qualified professional asset manager” 
(“QPAM”) and the other requirements thereof are satisfied.  A QPAM is defined to include an investment 
adviser registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act which has met certain thresholds 
regarding client assets under management and control as well as shareholders’ or partners’ equity.  The 
“QPAM Exemption,” however, does not exempt certain transactions, such as those between a QPAM and 
itself or an affiliate of the QPAM, and those between a QPAM and the party who has the authority to hire, 
fire or negotiate the terms of the agreement with the QPAM.  Nor does the QPAM Exemption permit the 
purchase or holding of employer securities that are not “qualifying employer securities” as provided in 
Section 407 of ERISA or the purchase or holding of “qualifying employer securities” in excess of the limits 
described in Section 407 of ERISA.  In addition, the QPAM Exemption will not apply with respect to 
transactions involving a Plan if the assets of such Plan, when combined with the assets of other Plans 
maintained by the same employer or an affiliate of such employer or by the same employee organization, 
represent more than 20% of the total client assets managed by the QPAM. 
In order for the Investment Manager to avoid engaging in any actions that

than the offering price for the security as established by the current bid and ask prices quoted by persons 
independent of the issuer of the security and of the party in interest.  For assets without a generally 
recognized market, adequate consideration is the price determined in good faith by the Plan Fiduciaries in 
accordance with regulations issued by the DOL. 
Although the exemptions described above do not apply to the payment by the Master Fund of 
Management Fees or Performance Allocations, the payment by the Master Fund to the Investment Manager 
of any Management Fees or to the Master Fund GP of any Performance Allocation will not be a prohibited 
transaction under Section 406(a) of ERISA or Section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code as long as the 
requirements for the exemption set forth in Section 408(b)(2) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(2) of the Code 
permitting payment for necessary services are met.  These requirements generally are that the services 
performed by the Investment Manager and the Master Fund GP are appropriate and helpful to the Plan in 
carrying out the purposes for which the Plan is maintained, that the arrangement with the Fund and the 
Master Fund for provision of such services and the Management Fee and Performance Allocation paid by 
the Master Fund are reasonable and that such fees are disclosed in accordance with applicable regulations 
promulgated under Section 408(b)(2) of ERISA.  The Plan Fiduciary must determine whether these 
requirements are satisfied with respect to the Master Fund’s payment to the Investment Manager of 
Management Fees and to the Master Fund GP of any Performance Allocation, respectively, which fees and 
allocations are disclosed in the sections “Fees and Expenses; Performance Allocations — Management 
Fee” and “— Performance Allocations” of this Memorandum.  In making such determination, the Plan 
Fiduciary should be aware that in calculating any Management Fee and Performance Allocation to be paid 
to the Investment Manager and the Master Fund GP, respectively, assets of the Fund and the Master Fund 
will be valued as described under “Net Asset Value.” 
The DOL has indicated that in certain circumstances the payment of a performance fee, such as the 
Performance Allocation, based on the increase in value of an account held by an employee benefit plan can 
constitute a prohibited transaction under Section 406(b) of ERISA.  The DOL has issued four opinion letters 
with respect to performance fees paid in connection with securities or commodity and futures contract 
transactions to investment advisers registered under the Advisers Act where it stated that under the 
circumstances set forth therein, the payment of a performance fee would not violate Section 406(b) of 
ERISA.  In these letters, the DOL appeared to base its conclusion on the following:  (i) that the performance 
fee was based on a calculation of net profits that reflected realized and unrealized gains and losses, (ii) t

transaction.  This position has not been confirmed by, and is not binding on, the DOL, which has the 
authority to promulgate regulations under ERISA as well as issue opinion and information letters 
thereunder.  Moreover, it is possible that the DOL, if it were to opine on a performance fee that is similar 
to the Performance Allocation, may disagree with this position.  Therefore, the Plan Fiduciary should 
consult with his or her attorney on this matter. 
The consequences of any prohibited transaction, if no exemption applies, can include the imposition 
of excise taxes on the “party in interest” or “disqualified person,” as such terms are defined in Section 3(14) 
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, respectively, the persons involved in the transaction having to 
rescind the transaction and pay an amount to the Plan for any losses realized by the Plan or profits realized 
by such persons, disqualification of any individual retirement account involved in the transaction with 
adverse tax consequences to the owner of such account, and other liabilities that can have a significant, 
adverse effect on such persons.  As a result, concerns over prohibited transactions may restrict the types of 
investments the Master Fund will make or have other adverse consequences on the operation of the Master 
Fund. 
A PLAN FIDUCIARY MUST CONSULT ITS OWN ERISA ADVISORS BEFORE INVESTING

SIGNIFIES ITS INFORMED CONSENT TO ALL SUCH PAYMENTS TO THE RECIPIENTS 
THEREOF AND TO THE RISKS INVOLVED IN INVESTING IN THE FUND. 
Indicia of Ownership 
Section 404(b) of ERISA requires that the “indicia of ownership” of all Plan Assets be maintained 
within the jurisdiction of the United States district courts.  During any time that the assets of the Master 
Fund are Plan Assets, it is likely that the DOL would take the position that such assets are subject to Section 
404(b) of ERISA.  Accordingly, the Investment Manager will cause the indicia of ownership of all assets 
of the Master Fund that are considered to be Plan Assets to be held within the jurisdiction of the United 
States district courts unless an exception applies.  A regulation issued by the DOL under Section 404(b) of 
ERISA provides certain exceptions from the indicia of ownership rule of Section 404(b) of ERISA if the 
requirements of such regulation are satisfied.  If an exception contained in such regulation applies to an 
asset held by the Master Fund, the indicia of ownership requirement of Section 404(b) of ERISA will be 
satisfied by complying with the requirements of the regulation.  However, if the requirements of the 
regulation cannot be satisfied with respect to an asset and the indicia of ownership of such asset cannot be 
held within the jurisdiction of the United States district courts, the Master Fund will be prevented from

Other Requirements 
ERISA also imposes a bonding requirement on the Investment Manager.  This requirement will be 
fulfilled by the Investment Manager to the extent applicable. 
Finally, ERISA imposes a requirement that all assets of the Plan be held in trust.  This requirement 
should be fulfilled by each Plan’s trustee holding its confirmation of ownership of the Shares in trust.  
ERISA does not require that the assets of the Fund or the Master Fund be held in trust.

SUBSCRIPTION PROCEDURE 
General 
The Fund generally intends to offer Shares as of the beginning of each calendar month and on such 
other dates as the Investment Manager may determine (each, a “Subscription Date”).   
The Fund initially offered Series A1 Founders Shares and Series A2 Founders Shares during a 
limited offering period that expired on June 30, 2024, subject to the Founders Capacity Rights. The Series 
A1 Founders Shares and Series A2 Founders Shares are identical except that they are subject to Performance 
Allocations determined pursuant to different calculation methodologies. Qualifying investors may 
subscribe for only Series A1 Founders Shares or Series A2 Founders Shares, as well as subscribe for and 
hold both Series A1 Founders Shares and Series A2 Founders Shares. 
The Fund is currently offering Series B1 Shares, Series B2 Shares and Series B3 Shares during the 
B Shares Investment Period and Series C1 Shares during the C Shares Investment Period. The series of 
Shares differ from each other with respect to their Redemption terms, Management Fee terms and certain 
aspects of their Performance Allocation terms. 
Except for the Founders Capacity Rights, the B Shares Capacity Rights and the C Shares Capacity 
Rights, the Fund may cease offering any class or series of Shares at

The minimum initial Subscription by an investor is $25 million with respect to Founders Shares, 
$50 million with respect to Series B1 Shares and $100 million with respect to Series B2 Shares, Series B3 
Shares and Series C1 Shares.  Additional Subscriptions may be made in whole multiples of $1,000,000, 
whether at the time of an initial Subscription or thereafter.  Subscriptions generally must be made in cash 
unless otherwise determined by the Investment Manager in its sole discretion.  
The Fund may accept or reject Subscriptions by a prospective or existing Shareholder in whole or 
in part, and waive or change the foregoing minimums (subject to a regulatory minimum initial investment 
amount of $100,000 or such other amount as prescribed under Cayman Islands law).   
In order to subscribe for Shares, a completed and executed Subscription Agreement (if an investor 
is making an initial Subscription for Shares) or a short-form Subscription Agreement (if an investor is 
making a subsequent investment in the Fund), as well as all required anti-money laundering documentation, 
should be received by the Administrator by facsimile or email at least five (5) Business Days prior to the 
relevant Subscription Date (or such other period required by the Administrator). 
Subscription proceeds generally must be received by the Fund no less than two (2) Business Days 
prior to the intended Subscription Date.  Any Subscriptions received late may be rejected or held over until 
the next available Subscription Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fund may, but shall have no 
obligation to, accept Subscriptions through the close of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day (and, in 
unusual circumstances, later than such fifth (5th) Business Day) following the Subscription Date (with such 
Subscription being effective as of such Subscription Date); provided, that the related Subscription 
Agreement had been received and accepted prior to such Subscription Date. 
Procedures and requirements for the delivery of Subscription Agreements and Subscriptions to the 
Fund are set forth in the Subscription Agreement or will otherwise be provided to investors by the Fund.  
All Subscriptions are irrevocable unless the Investment Manager determines otherwise. 
Investors whose Subscription Agreements are accepted will not be credited with any interest earned 
on Subscriptions received prior to the issuance of their Shares; rather, any such interest will become a 
general asset of the Fund.  If a Subscription Agreement is rejected, any Subscription tendered will be 
promptly returned to the subscriber, without interest.  Subscribers should not transmit their Subscriptions 
until the Administrator has confirmed the Fund has accepted the subscriber’s Subscription Agreement.  
Where a Subscription for Shares is accepted, the Shares will be treated as having been issued with 
effect from the relevant Subscription Date notwithstanding that the subscriber for those Share

GENERAL 
Registered Office 
The Fund was incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company under the provisions of the 
Cayman Islands Companies Act (As Revised) (the “Companies Act”) on April 27, 2023 for an unlimited 
duration.  The Fund’s registered office is Maples Corporate Services Limited, PO Box 309, Ugland House, 
Grand Cayman KY1-1104, Cayman Islands. 
Capitalization 
The Fund has an authorized share capital of $50,000 divided into 1,000 Management Shares of 
$1.00 par value and 49,000,000 Shares of $0.001 par value each.  The Management Shares, which are held 
by the Investment Manager, do not participate in the profits and losses of the Fund and are not redeemable. 
The Fund will issue a separate Sub-Series of the applicable series of Shares to each Shareholder 
with a Net Asset Value determined separately based on such Shareholder’s individual investment 
experience in the Fund.  The Shares of each Sub-Series are initially issued at $1,000 per Share on the 
Subscription Date and subsequently at the Net Asset Value per Share of that Sub-Series.  Each Sub-Series 
is adjusted to reflect such Sub-Series’ share of the Fund’s net profits or losses, Management Fees, 
Performance Allocations to the Master Fund GP (if applicable), Subscriptions and Redemptions. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Shareholder subscribes for Shares subject to different terms, 
such Shareholder will be issued separate Sub-Series of Shares that will be accounted for separately as 
though they were held by different Shareholders (including for purposes of effectuating Redemptions and 
calculating Management Fees and Performance Allocations).  Similarly, if a Shareholder makes more than 
one subscription for the same series of Shares on different Subscription Dates, the Fund may issue a separate 
Sub-Series for purposes of accounting for each subscription separately, if and as set forth in a series-specific 
Supplement to this Memorandum. 
Shares are held in registered form only.  If a Shareholder demonstrates that it is legally obligated 
to hold a share certificate, a share certificate will be provided as soon as reasonably practicable after the 
request is made.  The Shares are not expected to be listed on any stock exchange. 
Subject to applicable laws, the Fund may establish, without prior notice to Shareholders, new 
classes, tranches or series which may vary with respect to, among other things, currency denominations, 
investment minimums, fee structures, transparency, liquidity, voting and distribution rights; provided, that 
the Directors believe doing so will not have a material adverse effect on existing Shareholders.  New classes, 
tranches or series may be established by the Directors without Shareholder approval, unless the new class, 
tranche or series would have a preferential claim upon the assets of the Fund on a winding up in relation to 
another class, tranche or series, in which case the approval of the holders of a majority by Net Asset

Confidentiality 
Each Shareholder agrees that such Shareholder will not distribute any information regarding the

Investment Manager and that such Shareholder’s investment in the Fund, as well as that all information 
concerning the Investment Manager and the Fund, including the performance of such Shareholder’s

applicable to the Shareholder’s beneficial owners and controllers, subject to a request for information made 
by a regulatory or governmental authority or agency under applicable law, including by the Authority, either 
for itself or for a recognized overseas regulatory authority, under the Monetary Authority Act (As Revised), 
or by the TIA, under the Tax Information Authority Act (As Revised) and associated regulations, 
agreements, arrangements and memoranda of understanding.  Disclosure of confidential information under 
such laws or any similar laws will not be regarded as a breach of any duty of confidentiality and, in certain 
circumstances, the Fund, or any Directors or agents, may be prohibited from disclosing that the request has 
been made. 
Prospective Shareholders are required to acknowledge and consent in the Subscription Agreement 
that the Fund, the Investment Manager Parties, the Administrator, and their respective affiliates may 
disclose to each other, to any regulatory body, to a delegate, agent or any other service provider in any 
jurisdiction, including those outside of the United States, Cayman Islands, or the European Economic Area, 
copies of the prospective Shareholder’s Subscription Agreement and any information concerning the 
subscriber provided by the Shareholder to the Fund, the Investment Manager Parties and/or the 
Administrator.  Any such disclosure will not be treated as a breach of any restriction upon the disclosure of 
information imposed on such person by applicable law or otherwise.  
Privacy Policy and Collection and Use of Personal Information 
The Investment Manager has adopted a privacy policy designed to protect persons who invest in 
the Fund, as required by the Advisers Act.  The Fund and the Investment Manager may obtain non-public 
personal information about persons who become or subscribe to become Shareholders of the Fund.  Such 
information includes, for example, address, telephone number, e-mail address, social security number, 
passport number and other information pertaining to each such person’s investment in the Fund.  
The Investment Manager’s and Fund’s policies govern the collection, use, retention, and disclosure 
of information about an identifiable individual, but not the name, title, business address or telephone 
number of an employee of an organization (“personal information”), including investors and employees 
of the Investment Manager.  The Investment Manager and the Fund will not knowingly collect an 
individual’s personal information without consent of that individual.  The Investment Manager and the 
Fund will use the personal information of an individual only for the purpose it was collected unless it has 
consent of that individual.  The Investment Manager and the Fund will not knowingly disclose personal 
information to a third party without consent of that individual.

A copy of the Investment Manager’s privacy policy will be circulated annually to all Shareholders. 
Voting Rights 
The Investment Manager, as the holder of the Management Shares, has the right to receive notice 
of, attend and vote at general meetings of the Fund.  Shareholders, as the holders of Shares, have no right 
to receive notice of, attend or vote at general meetings of the Fund, but may vote on variations of Share 
Rights as described below. 
The Management Shares carry voting rights, each Management Share conferring upon the holder 
thereof the right to receive notice of, and to attend and vote at, general meetings of the Fund.  The 
Management Shares do not participate in the profits of the Fund. 
Any amendment to the Master Fund’s Limited Partnership Agreement requiring the consent of its 
limited partners (including the Fund) will be taken on a “look through” basis, as though investors in the 
Fund were direct limited partners of the Master Fund for purposes of determining whether such amendment 
received the requisite majority vote by net asset value (i.e., each Feeder Fund (including the Fund) will cast 
a “split” vote and not a single vote in accordance with the majority vote of their respective investors). 
Amendment of the Articles 
Subject to any variation of Share Rights, the Articles may be amended by the holder of the 
Management Shares, which is the Investment Manager.  
Variation of Share Rights 
The Articles provide that, subject to the Companies Act and the other provisions of the Articles, all 
or any of the class rights or other terms of offer whether set out in this Memorandum, any Subscription 
Agreement or otherwise (including any representations, warranties or other disclosure relating to the offer 
or holding of Shares) (collectively referred to as “Share Rights”) for the time being applicable to any class 
or series in issue (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of those Shares) may (whether or not the 
Fund is being wound up) be varied without the consent of the holders of the issued Shares of that class or 
series where such variation is considered by the Directors not to have a material adverse effect upon such 
holders’ Share Rights; otherwise, any such variation may be made with the prior consent in writing of the 
holders of not less than a majority by Net Asset Value of such Shares, or with the sanction of a resolution 
passed by at least a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at a separate meeting of the holders of 
such Shares.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors reserve the right, notwithstanding that any such 
variation may not have a material adverse effect, to obtain consent from the holders of such Shares.  Each 
subscriber for Shares will be required to agree that the terms of offer set out in the applicable Subscription 
Agreement and the rights attaching to the Shares can be varied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Articles.

Date”) specified by the Directors in such notice.  The terms of the Proposal shall be such that its specified 
effective date (the “Proposal Effective Date”) shall not be on or prior to the Specified Redemption Date.  
Such notice shall further provide that the holders of any Shares in respect of which a request for Redemption 
has not been received by the Redemption Request Date (the “Affected Shares”) shall, in the absence of 
express written refusal to consent, be deemed to have consented in writing to the Proposal (such Affected 
Shares being the “Negative Consent Shares”).  In the event that the Negative Consent Procedure is 
followed, only the Affected Shares shall be considered for the purposes of determining whether the written 
consent majority has been obtained under the “Variation of Share Rights” Article with the holders of the 
Negative Consent Shares being deemed to have submitted a written consent in favor of the Proposal on the 
Proposal Effective Date. 
Voluntary Limitation on Proportionate Shares 
The Subscription Agreement permits Shareholders who wish to do so, or are prohibited by law (for 
example, the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act) from holding Proportionate Shares in excess of specified 
levels, to limit their Proportionate Shares.  Maintaining a limit on a Shareholder’s Proportionate Share may 
require mandatory Redemptions or non-pro rata Dividends. 
Additional Classes or Series of Shares 
The Fund may in the future offer one or more additional or customized classes or series of Shares 
on terms different from those of other classes or series (which may include, but are not limited to, currency 
denominations, investment minimums, fee structures, liquidity, voting and distribution rights); provided, 
that the Investment Manager does not believe doing so will have a material adverse effect on existing 
Shareholders and such additional classes or series of Shares do not violate applicable law or regulations. 
New Issues 
From time to time the Fund may, to the extent permitted by the FINRA Rules, purchase securities 
which constitute New Issues.  Under the FINRA Rules, brokers generally may not sell such securities to a 
private investment fund if the fund has investors who are “Restricted Persons,” which includes persons 
employed by or affiliated with a broker and portfolio managers of hedge funds and other registered and 
unregistered investment advisory firms, or “Covered Investors,” which includes certain persons who are 
affiliated with certain companies that are current, former or prospective investment banking clients of the 
broker.  The profits and losses from New Issues will generally be allocated to investors in the Fund that are 
not Restricted Persons or Covered Investors.  The Fund may, however, avail itself of a “de minimis” 
exemption pursuant to which a portion of any New Issue profits and losses may be allocated to Restricted 
Persons and/or Covered Investors.

-102- 
Compliance with Law 
The application of a number of the laws and regulations to which the Investment Manager, the 
Master Fund GP and/or the Fund are subject are both uncertain and evolving.  The Investment Manager 
Parties and the Fund may unilaterally amend the Material Contracts in such a manner as such entities believe 
to be necessary or advisable in order to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and self-
regulatory determinations. 
Management of Fund Affairs 
The Shareholders take no part in the management, and have no voice in the operation, of the Fund, 
nor will Shareholders have any right to remove the Investment Manager.  Responsibility for managing the 
Fund and complete trading authority over its assets are vested in the Directors, which have delegated these 
responsibilities to the Investment Manager.  
Liquidation of the Fund 
If the Directors, in consultation with the Investment Manager, decide that the investment strategy 
or the Fund is no longer viable, they may resolve that the Fund be managed with the objective of realizing 
assets in an orderly manner and distributing the proceeds to Shareholders in such manner as they determine 
to be in the best interests of the Fund, in accordance with the terms of the Articles and this Memorandum, 
including, without limitation, mandatorily redeeming Shares, paying any Redemptions or Dividends in kind 
and/or declaring a suspension of Redemptions.  This process is integral to the business of the Fund and may 
be carried out without recourse to a formal liquidation under the Companies Act or any other applicable 
bankruptcy or insolvency regime, but shall be without prejudice to the right of the Share Trustee, as holder 
of the Management Shares, to place the Fund into liquidation. 
The Fund will commence a commercial wind down: (i) upon the bankruptcy, winding up or 
dissolution of the Investment Manager; or (ii) if the Directors, in consultation with the Investment Manager, 
so elect (which the Directors and the Investment Manager may do without prior notice and without any 
violation of the Articles, the Investment Management Agreement or of any fiduciary obligations). 
The Investment Manager (in consultation with the Directors) reserves the right to wind down the 
business and affairs of the Fund in such manner and upon such timeframe as it considers appropriate in its 
discretion.  
Side Letters 
The Investment Manager and the Fund have entered into “side letters” with certain Shareholders, 
and may do so in the future, which modify certain terms applicable to a Shareholder’s investment in the 
Fund which may include, but are not limited to, portfolio transparency rights, reduced fees and “most 
favored nations” protection.  However, the Investment Manager and the Fund will not grant any 
Shareholder, or any individual investor in any other Feeder Fund managed by the Investment Manager 
pursuing in the aggregate substantially similar strategies as the Fund,

not to give effect to such side letter), there can be no assurance that the side letter rights granted to one or 
more Shareholders will not in certain cases disadvantage others.   
The Investment Manager responds to requests from Shareholders or agrees to provide certain 
additional information to Shareholders.  However, the Investment Manager will not disclose information it 
believes to be material information to certain, but not to other, Shareholders or if such disclosure would 
violate applicable law or regulations. 
In the case of Shareholders that are subject to various statutory and/or regulatory requirements with 
respect to their investment in the Fund, the Investment Manager is expressly authorized to agree to such 
requirements with respect to such investment; provided, that the Investment Manager determines that 
accommodating such requirements will not give such Shareholders an unfair advantage as Shareholders 
over other Shareholders. 
Placement Agents 
Shares are currently being offered directly by the Fund.  The Investment Manager and/or the Fund 
may also engage duly licensed selling agents to assist in marketing the Shares, which may include one or 
more affiliates of the Investment Manager.  Shareholders introduced to the Fund through a placement agent 
may be subject to initial and/or ongoing placement or referral fees to the persons who introduced such 
Shareholders.  All affected investors will be informed of any such fees applicable to their Subscription prior 
to the acceptance of such Subscription (and may, if they wish, thereupon revoke their Subscription).  The 
Investment Manager and the Master Fund GP may also compensate persons who introduce investors out of 
their own resources (including by sharing a portion of the Management Fees and/or Performance 
Allocations with such placement agents). 
Prior Period Adjustments 
Each Shareholder may be required to pay, irrespective of whether such Shareholder remains a 
Shareholder, or permit the Investment Manager to reduce the Net Asset Value of such Shareholder’s Sub-
Series of Shares by, as the case may be, the amount of any liability or loss (or series of related liabilities or 
losses) which relates to a prior Accounting Period (a “Prior Period Adjustment”), and which exceeds 
2.5% of the Net Asset Value of the Fund as of the date that such Prior Period Adjustment would otherwise 
be allocated, that the Investment Manager determines to be due from such Shareholder or former 
Shareholder.  If a Prior Period Adjustment (or portion thereof) can be specifically identified as attributable 
to a Shareholder or a former Shareholder, then the Investment Manager may, in its sole discretion, use 
reasonable efforts to allocate such Prior Period Adjustment to, and collect such Prior Period Adjustment 
from, such Shareholder (by reduction of the Net Asset Value of such Shareholder’s Sub-Series of Shares 
or otherwise) or former Shareholder.  Otherwise, the Investment Manage

-104- 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Prior Period Adjustment results in income or 
gain rather than a cost or a liability for the Fund, such income or gain, irrespective of amount, will be 
allocated solely among those Persons that are Shareholders as of the time or times such income or gain is 
so received, in accordance with such Shareholders’ respective Proportionate Shares during the Accounting 
Period(s) when so received.  
Reports 
The Investment Manager generally intends to provide to each Shareholder: (i) a month-end, 
unaudited, net performance estimate for the Fund; (ii) a monthly investor statement including the unaudited 
closing Net Asset Value of such Shareholder’s Sub-Series; and (iii) such other information at such times as 
the Investment Manager may deem appropriate.  
Shareholders receive audited annual financial statements of the Fund.  The Investment Manager 
generally expects that the Fund’s audited financial statements with respect to a given fiscal year will be 
available within one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of such fiscal year.  There can, however, 
be no assurance as to when such financial statements will be available (as unforeseeable circumstances 
could arise that delay completion of an audit).   
The Fund’s audited financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The Fund’s Gross 
and Net Asset Values are also generally calculated in accordance with GAAP.  However, such Net Asset 
Values for purposes of Redemptions, Management Fees and Performance Allocations and other Fund 
purposes may contain certain non-GAAP components, such as the amortization of organizational and initial 
offering costs against Net Asset Value. 
The Investment Manager may furnish, at the Fund’s expense, additional reports and information 
concerning the Investment Manager and the Fund to certain Shareholders and not to other Shareholders, 
generally in order to meet such Shareholders’ institutional or regulatory needs to receive such reports and 
information, but only if the Investment Manager believes that such additional reports and information do 
not contain material information not distributed to other Shareholders. 
Issuance and Redemption Prices 
Details of the price at which a Subscription was accepted may be obtained by the relevant 
Shareholder from the Investment Manager. 
Details of the Redemption price applicable to any Shares may be obtained by the relevant redeemed 
Shareholder from the Investment Manager. 
Availability of Documents 
The description and summaries of documents in this Memorandum do not purport to be complete; 
investors should refer to the actual documents for a complete statement and to understand their terms and 
conditions. 
Electronic Delivery of Documents 
The Fund (and/or the Administrator on its behalf) delivers to the Shareholders audited financial 
statements annually and unaudited interim account statements monthly, as well as other investor notices.

documents, offers to deliver annual privacy notices and other investor notices and materials by e-mail to 
the address in the Fund’s records or password-protected Internet website.  When delivering documents by 
e-mail or posting them on a password-protected Internet website, the Fund generally distributes them as 
attachments to e-mails in Adobe’s Portable Document Format (“PDF”).  (The Adobe Acrobat Reader 
software is available free of charge from Adobe’s web site at www.adobe.com.  The Reader software must 
correctly be installed on the investor’s system before one will be able to view documents in PDF.)  By 
acquiring Shares, each Shareholder is consenting to electronic delivery of such documents.  Investors who 
do not wish to receive such documents electronically, or who wish to change the method of notice, must so 
elect by notifying the Investment Manager in writing. 
Disclosures Regarding Shareholders 
In order to comply with U.S. and international laws aimed at the prevention of money laundering 
and terrorist financing, each prospective investor who is an individual is required to represent in the 
Subscription Agreement that, among other things, such prospective investor is not, nor is any person or 
entity owning more than 10% of such prospective investor, nor any senior management official of the 
prospective investor, nor any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the 
prospective investor:  (i) a “Prohibited Investor” as defined in the Subscription Agreement (generally, a 
person involved in money laundering or terrorist activities, including those persons or entities that are 
included on any relevant lists maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (“OFAC”)) or (ii) any senior foreign political figure, an immediate family member or close 
associate of a senior foreign political figure, or any foreign shell bank.  The Administrator or the Investment 
Manager may require a prospective investor to submit additional anti-money laundering documentation, 
and such prospective investor’s Subscription will not be accepted until such additional information is 
received by and deemed satisfactory to the Administrator.  
Cayman Islands Data Protection 
The Fund has certain duties under the Data Protection Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the 
“DPA”) based on internationally accepted principles of data privacy. 
The Fund has prepared a document outlining the Fund’s data protection obligations and the data 
protection rights of investors (and individuals connected with investors) under the DPA (the “Fund Privacy 
Notice”).  The Fund Privacy Notice is contained within the Subscription Agreement and is available to 
existing investors by contacting the Investment Manager. 
Prospective investors should note that, by virtue of making investments in the Fund and the 
associated interactions with the Fund and its affiliates and/or delegates (including completing the 
Subscr

-106- 
Oversight of the DPA is the responsibility of the Ombudsman’s office of the Cayman Islands. 
Breach of the DPA by the Fund could lead to enforcement action by the Ombudsman, including the 
imposition of remediation orders, monetary penalties or referral for criminal prosecution. 
Sanctions 
The Fund is subject to laws that restrict it from dealing with entities, individuals, organisations 
and/or investments which are subject to applicable sanctions regimes. 
Accordingly, the Fund will require the subscriber to represent and warrant, on a continuing basis, 
that it is not, and that to the best of its knowledge or belief its beneficial owners, controllers or authorised 
persons (“Related Persons”) (if any) are not; (i) named on any list of sanctioned entities or individuals 
maintained by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or the United 
Nations or pursuant to European Union (“EU”) and/or United Kingdom (“UK”) Regulations (as the latter 
are extended to the Cayman Islands by Statutory Instrument) and/or Cayman Islands legislation, (ii) 
operationally based or domiciled in a country or territory in relation to which sanctions imposed by the 
United Nations, OFAC, the EU, the UK and/or the Cayman Islands apply, or (iii) otherwise subject to 
sanctions imposed by the United Nations, OFAC, the EU, the UK (including as the latter are extended to 
the Cayman Islands by Statutory Instrument) or the Cayman Islands (collectively, a “Sanctions Subject”).    
Where the subscriber or a Related Person is or becomes a Sanctions Subject, the Fund may be 
required immediately and without notice to the subscriber to cease any further dealings with the subscriber 
and/or the subscriber’s interest in the Fund until the subscriber or the relevant Related Person (as applicable) 
ceases to be a Sanctions Subject, or a licence is obtained under applicable law to continue such dealings (a 
“Sanctioned Persons Event”).  The Fund, the Directors, the Investment Manager Parties and the 
Administrator shall have no liability whatsoever for any liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and/or losses 
(including, but not limited to, any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of revenue, 
loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and legal costs and all other professional costs and expenses) 
incurred by the subscriber as a result of a Sanctioned Persons Event. 
In addition, should any investment made on behalf of the Fund subsequently become subject to 
applicable sanctions, the Fund may immediately and without notice to the Shareholder cease any further 
dealings with that investment until the applicable sanctions are lifted or a licence is obtained under 
applicable law to continue such dealings.

In addition to OFAC restrictions, in order to comply with legislation or regulations aimed at the 
prevention of money laundering and the countering of terrorist and proliferation financing the Fund is 
required to adopt and maintain procedures, and may require subscribers to provide evidence to verify their 
identity, the identity of their beneficial owners/controllers (where applicable), and source of funds. Where 
permitted, and subject to certain conditions, the Fund may also rely upon a suitable person for the 
maintenance of these procedures (including the acquisition of due-diligence information) to a suitable 
person.  
The Fund, and the Administrator on the Fund’s behalf, reserves the right to request such 
information and/or documentation as is necessary to verify the identity and/or source of funds of a 
Shareholder (i.e., a subscriber or a transferee) and the identity of their beneficial owners/controllers (where 
applicable), and their source of subscription funds.  In some cases the Directors, or the Administrator on 
the Fund’s behalf, may be satisfied that full due diligence is not required where a relevant exemption applies 
under applicable law.  However, detailed verification information may be required prior to the payment of 
any proceeds from or any transfer of an interest in Shares. 
In the event of delay or failure on the part of the subscriber in producing any information and/or 
documentation required for verification purposes, the Fund, or the Administrator on the Fund’s behalf, may 
refuse to accept (or process in the case of the Administrator) the application or if the application has already 
occurred, may suspend or redeem the Shares, in which case any funds received will, to the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable law, be returned without interest to the account from which they were originally 
debited.  
The Fund, and the Administrator on the Fund’s behalf, also reserves the right to refuse to make any 
Redemption or Dividend payment to a Shareholder if the Directors or the Administrator suspect or are 
advised that the payment of Redemption or Dividend proceeds to such Shareholder may be non-compliant 
with applicable laws or regulations, or if such refusal is considered necessary or appropriate to ensure the 
compliance by the Fund or the Administrator with any applicable laws or regulations.  Additionally, the 
Fund, the Investment Manager, the Administrator and their respective agents may request such further 
information as they consider necessary to process a Redemption request and may refuse to remit 
Redemption proceeds (that is “freeze” the Redemption proceeds) until proper and satisfactory information 
has been provided.  The Fund, the Investment Manager, the Administrator and their respective agents shall 
have no liability if there are losses due to a delay in or refusal to admit the investor, as a result of inadequate 
information from the applicant. 
The Authority has a discretionary power

If any person in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or 
suspecting that another person is engaged in criminal conduct or money laundering or is involved with 
terrorism or terrorist financing and property and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to 
their attention in the course of business in the regulated sector, or other trade, profession, business or 
employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to:  (i) the Financial 
Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act (As Revised) of the 
Cayman Islands if the disclosure relates to criminal conduct or money laundering or (ii) a police officer of 
the rank of constable or higher, or the Financial Reporting Authority, pursuant to the Terrorism Act (As 
Revised) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing 
and property.  Such a report shall not be treated as a breach of confidence or of any restriction upon the 
disclosure of information imposed by any enactment or otherwise.   
Investors may obtain details (including contact details) of the AML Compliance Officer, Money 
Laundering Reporting Officer and Deputy Money Laundering Reporting Officer of the Fund, by contacting 
the Investment Manager at IR@linonia.com.   
Personal Trading 
The Investment Manager has adopted a policy intended to restrict and monitor all personal trading 
by the employees of the Investment Manager in order to ensure that there is no conflict between such 
personal trading and the interests of the investment funds managed by the Investment Manager and the 
Investment Manager’s other clients.   
Handling of Mail   
Mail addressed to the Fund and received at its registered office will be forwarded unopened to the 
forwarding address supplied by the Directors to be dealt with.  None of the Fund, its Directors, officers, 
advisors or service providers (including the organization which provides registered office services in the 
Cayman Islands) will bear any responsibility for any delay howsoever caused in mail reaching the 
forwarding address.  In particular, the Directors will only receive, open or deal directly with mail which is 
addressed to them personally (as opposed to mail which is addressed just to the Fund).  
Beneficial Ownership Regime   
Under the Beneficial Ownership Transparency Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the 
“BOTA”), unless a Cayman Islands entity is able to avail itself of an alternative route to compliance, it is 
required to take reasonable steps to identify its beneficial owners and certain intermediate holding entities, 
and to maintain a beneficial ownership register at its registered office in the Cayman Islands. 
The Fund (or its subsidiaries) may be required to provide beneficial ownership information to its 
corporate services provider or other authorised contact of the Fund which, in turn, will provide

The Fund has appointed an Authorised Contact in order to comply with the BOTA, in lieu of 
maintaining a beneficial ownership register.  
LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING MATTERS 
Sidley Austin LLP, Chicago, Illinois, served as U.S. legal counsel to the Investment Manager in 
connection with the organization of the Fund and the preparation of this Memorandum.  Sidley Austin LLP 
may continue to serve in such capacity in the future, but has not assumed any obligation to update this 
Memorandum.  Sidley Austin LLP may advise the Investment Manager in matters relating to the operation 
of the Fund on an ongoing basis.  Sidley Austin LLP does not represent and has not represented the 
prospective investors or the Fund in the course of the organization of the Fund, the negotiation of its 
business terms, the offering of the Shares or in respect of its ongoing operations.  Prospective investors 
must recognize that, as they have had no representation in the organization process, the terms of the Fund 
relating to themselves and the Shares have not been negotiated at arm’s length. 
Sidley Austin LLP’s engagement by the Investment Manager in respect of the Fund is limited to 
the specific matters as to which it is consulted by the Investment Manager and, therefore, there may exist 
facts or circumstances which could have a bearing on the Fund’s (or the Investment Manager’s) financial 
condition or operations with respect to which Sidley Austin LLP has not been consulted and for which 
Sidley Austin LLP expressly disclaims any responsibility.  More specifically, Sidley Austin LLP does not 
undertake to monitor the compliance of the Investment Manager and its affiliates with the trading program, 
valuation procedures and other guidelines set forth herein, nor does it monitor compliance with applicable 
Law.  In preparing this Memorandum, Sidley Austin LLP relied upon information furnished to it by the 
Fund and/or the Investment Manager, and did not investigate or verify the accuracy and completeness of 
information set forth herein concerning the Investment Manager, the Fund’s service providers and their 
affiliates. 
Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP (“Maples and Calder”) acts as Cayman Islands legal counsel 
to the Fund.  In connection with the Fund’s offering of Shares and subsequent advice to the Fund, Maples 
and Calder will not be representing Shareholders.  No independent legal counsel has been retained to 
represent the Shareholders.  Maples and Calder’s representation of the Fund is limited to specific matters 
as to which it has been consulted by the Fund.  There may exist other matters that could have a bearing on 
the Fund as to which Maples and Calder has not been consulted.  In addition, Maples and Calder does not
