Investors continued to grapple with inflationary pressures that, while moderating, remained above central bank targets. The prolonged tightening cycle has caused shifting expectations around rate cuts, which created a complicated environment for markets.\n[PÁGINA 5 CONTÉM 1 IMAGENS]\n[PÁGINA 5 CONTÉM 2 TABELAS]\n\n2024 also presented a complex geopolitical landscape, with markets remaining volatile amid uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election for most of the year and ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The associated uncertainty and tension added another layer of complexity to an already challenging macroeconomic environment.",

Investors continued to grapple with inflationary pressures that, while moderating, remained above central \nbank targets. The prolonged tightening cycle has caused shifting expectations around rate cuts, which created a complicated \nenvironment for markets.  \n2024 also presented a complex geopolitical landscape, with markets remaining volatile amid uncertainty surrounding the U.S. \npresidential election for most of the year and ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The associated \nuncertainty and tension added another layer of complexity to an already challenging macroeconomic environment.  \nDespite these headwinds, U.S. equity markets demonstrated resilience, driven largely by the strength of a handful of mega-cap \ntechnology companies. While the results of those companies led to strong index-level returns, they also underscored the \ngrowing dispersion in results among the underlying companies. Against this backdrop, the Board is pleased to report that PSH \ndelivered solid performance over the year, benefiting from a disciplined investment approach and a focus on high-quality, \ndurable businesses positioned to make sound business progress in varying economic environments.  \nThe Investment Manager takes a long-term approach to investing and the Board does not expect NAV appreciation to \noutperform the S&P 500 every year. Rather, it expects the Investment Manager to outperform over the long-term – and it has \ndone so over recent periods. The Board commends the Investment Manager’s impressive 22.9% seven-year compound annual \nNAV return and 22.2% five-year compound annual NAV return as of December 31, 2024; as well as share price appreciation of \n21.1% and 21.6%, respectively, over the same periods.i,ii So, while the Investment Manager underperformed the S&P 500 in \n2024, it has outperformed the S&P 500 over the seven and five year periods.iii\nThe Investment Manager has had a strong relative start to 2025 with a year-to-date return of -0.6% and share price \nappreciation of 0.1% as of March 11, 2025.iv  By comparison, the S&P 500 has decreased 5.0% over the same period.\nDuring the year, the Board engaged in a number of corporate actions to benefit shareholders, which I discuss in detail below. \nThe Investment Manager also undertook several corporate initiatives designed to position itself for continued long-term \nsuccess. The Board was pleased to see that in addition to these initiatives, the Investment Manager made three new \ninvestments over the past year, demonstrating robust idea generation and investment activity.  \nI detail PSH’s investment performance as well as provide additional information about recent actions taken by the Board in the \npages that follow.   \nINVESTMENT PERFORMANCE\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, PSH’s Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share, including dividends, increased by 10.2% \nnet of fees, ending the year at $71.11 per share. PSH’s share price increased by 8.3% over the same period as a result of the \nwidening of the discount to NAV at which PSH shares traded from 29.6% to 31.2%.v,vi By comparison, the S&P 500 increased \n25.0% during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe performance of the entire portfolio along with additional information about the Investment Manager’s hedging program is \ndiscussed in more detail in the Investment Manager’s Report.",

These businesses tend to be large cap companies domiciled in North America that generate relatively predictable \nand growing free cash flows, with formidable barriers to entry and a compelling value proposition. The Investment Manager \ncontinues to engage constructively with many of PSH’s portfolio companies through direct board representation in some \nsituations, and less formal, private engagement in others.\nPSH continues to believe that its ability to access low cost, long-term, investment grade debt is a competitive advantage, and \nits long-term debt management strategy is to manage leverage over time by increasing NAV through strong performance and \nreplacing maturing bonds with new issuances. PSH’s debt profile is comprised of a laddered set of maturities, matching its \nlong-term investment horizon, with a weighted average maturity of 7 years and a weighted average cost of capital of 3.1% as \nof March 11, 2025. PSH’s total debt to total capital ratio as of March 11, 2025 is 15.7%.vii The Board believes that this amount \nof leverage is conservative, particularly given the quality, liquidity and mark-to-mark nature of PSH’s portfolio assets. PSH \ndoes not have any margin leverage nor any mark-to-market covenants on its outstanding bonds.\nPORTFOLIO CHANGES\nAs I wrote in my letter to you in August, the Investment Manager established new investments in Nike, which is in the early \nstages of a turnaround under new CEO Elliott Hill, and Brookfield, a leading alternative asset manager with high-quality and \nrapidly growing cash flows. Earlier this year, the Investment Manager also initiated an investment in Uber, the world’s leading \nrideshare and delivery marketplace that is well positioned for rapid earnings growth over the medium-term.\nFurther information on the PSH portfolio can be found in the Investment Manager’s Report.\nCORPORATE ACTIONS\nThe Board has undertaken a number of corporate actions over the past year.\n•\nOn June 3, 2024, the Investment Manager announced that it completed a sale to strategic investors of a 10% \ncommon equity interest in Pershing Square Holdco, L.P., a newly formed limited partnership that owns 100% of \nthe Investment Manager. The Board was supportive of this transaction which it believed would not impact the \nInvestment Manager’s team, its role in managing PSH, or the Investment Manager’s obligations under the IMA. The \nBoard further recognises that the strategic sale to a group of world-class, long-term partners will bolster the \nInvestment Manager’s business, for the benefit of PSH shareholders.\n•\nSince 2022, the Company has utilised a methodology for determining the future dividends that PSH pays which \nincrease based on NAV growth. In January 2025, based on this methodology, the dividends for 2025 increased by \n13%, the third increase since the adoption of the methodology. The dividend has now increased by 65% since the \ncommencement of the dividend program.",

The Board concluded that \ndelisting from Euronext Amsterdam and consolidating trading on the LSE would reduce regulatory complexity and \nimprove liquidity of PSH’s shares which would be to the benefit of PSH shareholders. The last day of trading of PSH \nShares on Euronext Amsterdam was on January 30, 2025, and delisting occurred on January 31, 2025.\n•\nThe Board authorised a total of $200 million in share repurchase programs in 2024. During the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares at an average price of $47.07 and an average \ndiscount to NAV of 30.6%. As of December 31, 2024, PSH has spent $1.4 billion to repurchase 67.0 million shares, \nrepresenting 26.9% of initial shares outstanding, at an average price of $21.24 and an average discount to NAV of \n29.3% since initiating its first share repurchase program on May 2, 2017.viii\nDISCOUNT TO NAV\nThe Board closely monitors the discount to NAV at which PSH’s Public Shares trade. During 2024, the discount widened to \n31.2% as of December 31, 2024, but has since narrowed slightly to 30.9% as of March 11, 2025.ix   \nAs discussed in previous communications, in February 2024, the Board disclosed that it approved amendments to the Variable \nPerformance Fee provisions in PSH’s IMA that could reduce the performance fees paid by PSH.   \nIn conjunction with that announcement, the Investment Manager discussed plans to launch new investment funds and on July \n9, 2024, the Investment Manager launched a roadshow for the initial public offering of the common shares of Pershing Square \nUSA, Ltd. (“PSUS”), a new investment holding company that was to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. On July 31, 2024, \nthe Investment Manager withdrew the PSUS IPO noting that it had decided to re-evaluate PSUS’s structure in light of investor \nfeedback.   \nDuring that July period, PSH’s discount to NAV narrowed meaningfully in anticipation of the PSUS IPO and potential associated \nreduction in PSH performance fees.   \nThe Board continues to believe that the introduction of additional funds managed by the Investment Manager will be a \npositive catalyst to narrow the discount to NAV at which PSH shares currently trade, and that the most powerful driver of \nlong-term shareholder returns and discount narrowing will be continued strong absolute and relative NAV performance.  \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE / BOARD\nThe Board continues to work effectively and diligently on behalf of all shareholders. Nicholas Botta retired as a non-executive \ndirector of the Company on November 15, 2024, having served as a director since 2012. Mr Botta has been a tremendous \ndirector and asset to the Board. The Board thanks him for his many contributions.\nThe Nomination Committee subsequently recommended the appointment of Halit Coussin, Chief Legal Officer and Chief \nCompliance Officer of the Investment Manager, to the Board as a non-executive director. Ms Coussin joined the Board with \neffect from November 15, 2024.\nEVENTS / SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\nPSH’s annual investor meeting was held on February 11, 2025. We had more investors in attendance this year than ever before \nand we were pleased to welcome hundreds more to the webcast of the event. I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to interact",
